PhragmÃƒÂ©n's Method is a proportional method that works without lists.

In 2002 there was a thread on the EM mailing list with subject "D'Hondt without lists" mentioning the PhragmÃƒÂ©n method.

Sketch of method:

* Voters vote for multiple candidates. The ballot is unordered
* Each elected candidate has a load of 1 which is distributed among his voters.
* The load of a candidate is not distributed evenly among its N voters, but rather such that each of the candidate's voters end up with the same cumulated load.
* The candidates are elected iteratively - in each step electing the one that results in the most even distribution of load (i.e. minimal load on the voter with the highest load - minmax)

In the case of 1 candidate to be elected, PhragmÃƒÂ©ns method degenerates to [[Approval Voting]] (because the candidate resulting in the minimal load on each voter is the one with most voters to share the load).
