ER-Bucklin is a version of [[Bucklin voting]] that allows voters to give equal rankings to some candidates. There are at least two main versions of ER-Bucklin; these are '''ER-Bucklin(whole)''' and '''ER-Bucklin(fractional)'''.


== ER-Bucklin(whole) ==

''If a ballot lists n candidates as tied in kth place, count that ballot as a whole point for all n candidates beginning in the kth round.''

Note: A candidate is ranked in kth place on a given ballot if there are k-1 candidates who are ranked strictly higher. For exampe, a ballot marked A>B=C=D>E>F=G=H=I>J should be considered to rank A to in 1st place, B, C, and D in 2nd place, E in 5th place, F, G, H, and I in 6th place, and J in 10th place. Thus, the ballot would not count in favor of E until the 5th round, and it would not count in favor of J until the 10th round.


== ER-Bucklin(fractional) ==

''If a ballot lists n candidates as tied in kth place, count that ballot as 1/n point for all n candidates in the kth round, adding another 1/n point in each subsequent round until the ballot has contributed 1 point to all n candidates.''


== Example ==

:36 voters: A>B1=B2>C
:34 voters: B1=B2>C>A
:30 voters: C>A>B1=B2

=== ER-Bucklin(whole) tally ===

There is a tie between B1 and B2.


=== ER-Bucklin(fractional) tally ===

{| border=1
!candidate
!round 1
!round 2
|-
|A
