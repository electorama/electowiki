The '''Non-compulsory support criterion''' was devised in 2005 by Thomas Smith. A voting method satisfies the Non-compulsory Support criterion if it provides a means for the voter to exclude one or more candidates from supportive ranking or rating.  Methods that satisfy this criterion include Approval voting, Range voting, Bucklin voting, voter truncated Borda count and standard STV methods.  Methods that do not satisfy this criterion include Condorcet methods, plurality voting, standard Borda count and non-truncatable STV methods.
