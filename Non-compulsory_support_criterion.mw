The '''Non-compulsory support criterion''' was devised in 2005 by Thomas Smith. A voting method satisfies the Non-compulsory Support criterion if it provides a means for the voter to exclude one or more candidates from supportive ranking or rating.  Methods that satisfy this criterion include [[Approval voting]], [[Range voting]], [[Bucklin voting]], voter truncated [[Borda count]] and standard [[Single Transferable Vote]] methods.  Methods that do not satisfy this criterion include [[Condorcet methods]], [[plurality voting]], standard [[Borda count]] and non-truncatable STV methods. For example, Approval and Range voting allow the voter to rate any candidate with a zero, which effectively does not give the candidates so rated any support.  Voter-truncated Borda count allows the voter to not rank any candidate, which gives them no support.
