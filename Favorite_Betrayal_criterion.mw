The '''Favorite Betrayal criterion''' is a criterion for evaluating [[voting system]]s.

==Definition==

A voter optimizes the outcome (from his own perspective) if his vote causes the election of the best possible candidate that can be elected, based on his own preferences, given all the votes cast by other voters.

==Statement of the criterion==

<em>For any voter who has a unique favorite, there should be no possible set of votes cast by the other voters such that the voter can optimize the outcome (from his own perspective) only by voting someone over his favorite.</em>

==Complying methods==

[[Approval voting]], [[range voting]], [[Majority Judgment]], [[MMPO|MinMax(pairwise opposition)]], [[MCA]] (except MCA-A and some versions of MCA-R), [[MAMPO]], and [[Improved Condorcet Approval]] comply with the favorite betrayal criterion. 

[[Borda count]], [[plurality voting]], [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet methods]], and [[instant-runoff voting]] do not comply.

==Commentary==

Election methods that meet this criterion provide no incentive for voters to betray their favorite candidate by voting another candidate over him or her.

An interpretation of this criterion applied to votes as cast is the [[Sincere Favorite criterion]].
