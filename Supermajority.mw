A '''supermajority''' or a '''qualified majority''' is a requirement for a proposal to gain a specified level or type of support which exceeds a [[simple majority]] in order to have effect.  For example: in some jurisdictions, [[parliamentary procedure]] requires that any action that may alter the rights of the [[minority]] has a supermajority requirement (such as a [[two-thirds majority]]).  Changes to [[constitution]]s, especially those with [[entrenched clause]]s, commonly require supermajority support in a [[legislature]].

The [[European Union]] [[Council of Ministers]], in order to balance the interests of small and large member states, uses a [[Qualified Majority Voting|qualified majority]] system for its decision-making.

The [[United States Senate]] requires a supermajority of 60 percent to move to a vote through a [[cloture]] motion, allowing a large minority to [[filibuster]].

The [[United States Constitution]] requires a supermajority of two-thirds of both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to propose a Congress-driven constitutional amendment; it also requires a three-fourths supermajority of [[U.S. state|state]] legislatures for final adoption of any constitutional amendment, as well as a two-thirds supermajority to pass a bill over the president's veto.
