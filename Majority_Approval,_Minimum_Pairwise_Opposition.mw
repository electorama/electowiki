'''Majority Approval, Minimum Pairwise Opposition''' or '''MAMPO''' is one method devised by Kevin Venzke for the purpose of showing that the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], the [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]], and the [[Strategy-Free criterion]] are mutually compatible.

Another method with these properties is [[Majority Defeat Disqualification Approval]].

==Procedure==
The voter submits a ranking of the candidates. The candidates explicitly ranked are considered ''approved'' by that voter.

The ''score'' for candidate ''X'' against candidate ''Y'' is equal to the number of voters ranking ''X'' above ''Y''. The ''max score'' of candidate ''X'' is the largest score of any other candidate against ''X''.

If fewer than one candidate is approved by more than half of the voters, then the candidate approved by the most voters is elected.

Otherwise, the candidate with the lowest max score, who is approved by more than half of the voters, is elected.

==Criteria==
'''MAMPO''' satisfies the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] (and [[Minimal Defense criterion]]), [[Monotonicity criterion|monotonicity]], and the [[Plurality criterion]].

It fails [[Strategic nomination|Clone-Winner]], the [[Generalized Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Condorcet criterion]], the [[Smith set|Smith criterion]], [[Participation criterion|Participation]], the [[Majority criterion|Majority criterion for solid coalitions]], and [[Later-no-harm criterion|Later-no-harm]].
