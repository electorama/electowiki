'''SCRIRVE''' is a voting system devised by Chris Benham for use with ranked ballots. 
Truncation is allowed, but in the standard version equal non-last preferences are not.
Truncated ballots are first symmetrically completed. Then, working on the reversed profile,
repeatedly eliminate the [[IRV]] "winner", until one candidate remains. That candidate is elected.

(The name of the voting system is an acronym, standing for "symmetrically complete, reverse, IRV elimination.")

"Symmetrically complete" here refers to a process that is applied to truncated ballots. Each truncated ballot is, as
Douglas Woodall puts it, "replaced" by "all possible completions of it with equal weight, chosen so that the total
weight is 1."
("''Symmetric-Completion''" (''SC'') is a Woodall criterion that says "a truncated ballot should be treated the same way as its
symmetric completion.")
An alternative  description of the system  makes no mention of symmetric completion: 
"Treat truncated ballots as giving equal-last preference to all the unranked candidates. Working on the reversed profile,
use ER-IRV (fractional) to repeatedly eliminate candidates until one (who is elected) remains. (Handle equal preferences by splitting them into 
equal fractions that sum to 1.)"

There is no truncation, so there is no "symmetric completing" to do. To use IRV on the reversed profile, we can begin by looking at the last preferences:

Memphis 58,   Knoxville 42,  Chattanooga 0,  Nashville 0.<br>
Memphis has more than half the last preferences, and so wins the first IRV election on the reversed profile; and so is  eliminated (and dropped from the ballots.)

New last preferences tallies:
<br>Knoxville 68,  Nashville 32,  Chattanooga 0.<br>
Knoxville has more than half the last preferences, and so wins the second IRV election on the reversed profile; and so is eliminated (and dropped from the ballots.)

New last preference tallies:
<br>Nashville 32,  Chattanooga 68.<br>
Chattanooga has more than half the last preferences, and so wins the third  IRV election on the reversed profile; and so is eliminated.
The one remaining candidate is Nashville, so Nashville is the winner.

Things are more simple when there are only three candidates.  In that case, SCRIRVE  elects the winner of the pairwise comparison between the candidate with the
fewest (fractional) last preferences (or the fewest on the symmetrically completed ballots); and the winner of the pairwise comparison between the other two
candidates. If the three candidates are in a cycle, then the winner is simply  always the candidate with the fewest (fractional) last preferences.
