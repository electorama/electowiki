'''Mean minimum political distance (MMPD)''' is a [[political spectrum]] statistic defined as the mean distance between a voter and the nearest elected candidate.

== Example ==

Assume a one-dimensional political spectrum with the voter distribution

* 15% at position 0
* 20% at position 0.25
* 30% at position 0.5
* 20% at position 0.75
* 15% at position 1

If the candidate set {0.25, 0.75} is elected, then

<table border>
   <tr>
      <th>voters</th>
      <th>position</th>
      <th>nearest winner</th>
      <th>distance</th>
      <th>voters Ã— distance</th>
   </tr>
   <tr align="right">
      <td>0.15</td>
      <td>0.00</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.0375</td>
   </tr>
   <tr align="right">
      <td>0.20</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.00</td>
      <td>0.0000</td>
   </tr>
   <tr align="right">
      <td>0.30</td>
      <td>0.55</td>
      <td>either</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.0750</td>
   </tr>
   <tr align="right">
      <td>0.20</td>
      <td>0.75</td>
      <td>0.75</td>
      <td>0.00</td>
      <td>0.0000</td>
   </tr>
   <tr align="right">
      <td>0.15</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
      <td>0.75</td>
      <td>0.25</td>
      <td>0.0375</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th colspan="4">sum of voters Ã— distance</th>
      <td align="right">0.1500</td>
   </tr>
</table>

The MMPD of this example is 0.15.

== Special cases ==

On a [[uniform linear political spectrum]]:

=== Random Ballots ===

''This section is a stub.''

=== Droop Multiples ===

Electing the candidates {i/(n+1): 1&le;i&le;n} gives an MMPD of (n+3)/(4(nÂ²+2n+1)).  As the number of seats approaches infinity, this is asymptotically equal to 1/(4n).
