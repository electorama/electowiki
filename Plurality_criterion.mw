<h4 class=left>Statement of Criterion</h4>

<p><em>If the number of ballots ranking ''A'' as the first preference is greater than the number of ballots on which another candidate ''B'' is given any preference, then ''B'' must not be elected.</em></p>

<h4 class=left>Complying Methods</h4>

<p>[[Plurality voting|First-Preference Plurality]], [[Approval voting]], [[IRV]], and many [[Condorcet method|Condorcet methods]] (using winning votes as defeat strength) satisfy the Plurality criterion. [[Condorcet method|Condorcet methods]] using margins as the measure of defeat strength fail it, as does [[Raynaud]] (using either winning votes or margins as the measure of defeat strength), and also [[Minmax|Minmax(pairwise opposition)]].</p>

<h4 class=left>Commentary</h4>

When the Plurality criterion requires that ''B'' not be elected, it means that even if all the voters who gave ''B some'' ranking were to elevate him to the top position, he would still not be the [[Plurality voting|First Preference Plurality]] winner.

It also means that ''A'' has a stronger pairwise victory over ''B'' than ''B'' has even a path of victories to any other candidate.

It is conceivable that if ''B'' were elected, voters might not consider this a legitimate result.
