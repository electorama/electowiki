<h4 class=left>Statement of Criterion</h4>

<p><em>If the number of ballots ranking ''A'' as the first preference is greater than the number of ballots on which another candidate ''B'' is given any preference, then ''A''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s probability of election must be greater than ''B''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s.</em></p>

<h4 class=left>Complying Methods</h4>

<p>[[Plurality voting|First-Preference Plurality]], [[Approval voting]], [[IRV]], and many [[Condorcet method|Condorcet methods]] (using winning votes as defeat strength) satisfy the Plurality criterion. [[Condorcet method|Condorcet methods]] using margins as the measure of defeat strength fail it, as do [[Raynaud]] regardless of the measure of defeat strength, and also [[Minmax|Minmax(pairwise opposition)]].</p>
