'''Voting Mechanics''' is concerned with the polling system itself as opposed to the methodology used in selecting alternatives.

Stalin said "It doesn't matter who votes.  It matters who counts the votes." And that is the best introduction I can give you concerning the purpose of this page and, perhaps further pages concerned with specifying an incorruptible on line polling system.

There is a certain irrelvancy as to the method of polling (IRV, Ranked Choice, Coraset (or whaever that is) or plurality or whatever when one focuses instead on the mechanics and the integrity of the systems.  And as a first installment on what I want to create I will say that in my utopian system we can all count the votes.  Stalin will not like it but most of us would probably disagree with him.

I will specify right here and now but, perhaps, subject to change after initial hurdles are cleared that there will be paper ballots do be caressed and fondled
and lovingly handled by lots of people in suits and high heels.  Not to worry.
But the actual counting of, or perhaps it is best described as the evaluation of, the result is done by computers in one way or another and by as many people who wish to do it.  It is not like computers are such a big mystry any more.  We all have one or we wouldn't by reading this.

The initial problem to be addressed is, therefore, access to the data; access to the ballots.  And there is no way that we can all fondle and caress the paper ballots.  No.  These ballots must be scaned by a machine that places the electonic version of the ballots into _MANY_ different database systems that are administered by many different organizations on different kinds of hardware running different kinds of database software on different operating systems.  Once the count of such systems exceeds 10 there is no effective way to defraud this portion of the polling system.  There are also monitor systems that serve to insure that the data in all the bases is identical.  Here again, read access is open to all.  If you want to compare one base with another just do it.  The authorities cannot be corrupted because there aren't any.

Having devised a safe depository for the data and having provided global access thereto we are now focussed on the single point of corruption being the scanning system or the link between that system and the database systems.  And here again multiplicity resolves the primary problem.

quiting time for now.  Ah be tired.  More tomorrow.
