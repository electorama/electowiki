'''Voting Mechanics''' is concerned with the polling system itself as opposed to the methodology used in selecting between various choices. There is a certain irrelvancy as to the method of selection (IRV, Ranked Choice, Condorset, or whatever) when one focuses instead on the integrity of the actual system employed to gather and count the ballots.  And these "mechanisms" are the subject of this article. Stalin said "It doesn't matter who votes.  It matters who counts the votes." And that is the best introduction we can have concerning the subject of this article  and, perhaps further articles concerned with specifying an incorruptible mechanism for ascertaining the will of the people.
