'''Voting Mechanics''' is concerned with the polling system itself as opposed to the methodology used in selecting between various choices. There is a certain irrelvancy as to the method of selection (IRV, Ranked Choice, Condorset, or whatever) when one focuses instead on the integrity of the actual system employed to gather and count the ballots.  And these "mechanisms" are the subject of this article. Stalin said "It doesn't matter who votes.  It matters who counts the votes." And that is the best introduction we can have concerning the subject of this article  and, perhaps further articles concerned with specifying an incorruptible mechanism for ascertaining the will of the people.

==Initial Provisions==

Let us understand that until it can be proved the most paranoid among us there will be paper ballots do be caressed and fondled and lovingly handled by lots of people in suits and high heels.  Not to worry.

Let us understand that limiting authority is equal to limiting corruption and to the extend that mechanisms are non authoritarian then to that extend are they non corrubtible.

Let us understand that in an incorruptible system of voting/polling that all participants (all voters) are granted '''READ''' access to the balot box such that they can all "''count the votes''" in whatever way we wish.

Let us understand that annonimity must be provided for those who desire it but that in specific cases where a voter wishes to claim fraud or corruption then annonimity of such claimant must be forfeit.
Let us understand that each of us is in authority to determine whether or not our vote is in the ballot box and whether or not the ballot reflects our actual selection(s), and there is a suitible and generally acceptable method by which we can prove the contrary should it become necessary.

But the actual counting of, or perhaps it is best described as the evaluation of, the result is done by computers in one way or another and by as many people who wish to do it.  It is not like computers are such a big mystry any more.  We all have one or we wouldn't by reading this.

The initial problem to be addressed is, therefore, access to the data; access to the ballots.  And there is no way that we can all fondle and caress the paper ballots.  No.  These ballots must be scaned by a machine that places the electonic version of the ballots into _MANY_ different database systems that are administered by many different organizations on different kinds of hardware running different kinds of database software on different operating systems.  Once the count of such systems exceeds 10 there is no effective way to defraud this portion of the polling system.  There are also monitor systems that serve to insure that the data in all the bases is identical.  Here again, read access is open to all.  If you want to compare one base with another just do it.  The authorities cannot be corrupted because there aren't any.

Having devised a safe depository for the data and having provided global access thereto we are now focussed on the single point of corruption being the scanning system or the link between that system and the database systems.  And here again multiplicity resolves the primary problem.

quiting time for now.  Ah be tired.  More tomorrow.
