The Commonwealth of '''Virginia''' is one of the fifty states in the [[United States]].

==Plurality requirement==
The Code of Virginia has a plurality requirement for local elections (see Elizabeth Reed's ''[http://www.fairvote.org/media/pep/VA.pdf Fair Elections and the Law for the Commonwealth of Virginia]''.) One of the relevant provisions states:

:24.2-673. Candidates having highest number of votes to receive certificate of election. 

:Except in the case of a recount pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 8 (? 24.2-800 et seq.) of this title, in all elections for the choice of any officer, unless it is otherwise expressly provided, the person having the highest number of votes for any office shall be deemed to have been elected to such office and shall receive the certificate of election.

:(Code 1950, 24-276; 1970, c. 462, 24.1-148; 1993, c. 641.)

==Reform efforts==
[[Virginians for Instant Runoff Voting]], or VIRV, is the main organization devoted to working for implementation of the [[single transferable vote]] in Virginia.

In [[2003]], Delegate [[William K. Barlow]] introduced [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?031+sum+HB2739 HB 2739], a bill to use IRV in all elections. In [[2004]], Barlow introduced [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?ses=041&typ=bil&val=hb956 HB 956], a less ambitious bill that would have allowed cities and counties to use IRV in local elections. The House Privileges and Elections Committee, chaired by Del. [[Lacey E. Putney]], voted unanimously to table it.
