'''Virginians for Instant Runoff Voting''', or '''VIRV''', is a group devoted to implementing the [[instant runoff voting]] in Virginia elections. Its website features a petition stating, "We the undersigned support the goal of Virginians for Instant Runoff Voting to elect our local, state, and federal officials by [[Single Transferable Vote]]." Post #156 to the InstantRunoffVA listserv indicates that this language was specifically chosen in order to encompass both multi-seat and single-seat preferential balloting.

[[Bill Redpath]] is on the VIRV advisory committee.
