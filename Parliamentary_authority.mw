=Parliamentary Authorities=

The number one book on parliamentary procedure is ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised'', 10th edition, 2000 (RONR).  More organizations prescribe RONR as their parliamentary authority (PA) than any other manual.  BUT there are other PAs, and one must check their bylaws or other rules to see if and what PA is prescribed for any given organization.

It should be noted that the 1915 edition (the 4th) is the latest that is no longer protected by copyright law, and that there are numerous ''Robert's Rules of Order'' derived from this edition by modern authors.  Some are merely the 4th edition with perhaps some formatting and illustration improvements, and others are a complete revision.  But the standard is the 10th edition published by Perseus Publishing.  [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0738203076/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-6655008-9239261#reader-link Amazon.com] has the table of contents and index.

The authorship team of RONR, 10th edition, have also published:

* ''Robert's Rules of Order in Brief'', March 2004.  This concise and user-friendly guide will expertly brief readers on the rules most often needed at meetings. It includes sample dialogues, helpful references to RONR, and handy tips for officers.
