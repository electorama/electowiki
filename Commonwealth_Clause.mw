'''Commonwealth Clause''' refers to a residency requirement for voting in Britain and some of its former colonies which en[[franchise]]s recently arrived non-citizen legal residents.  While most countries limit the franchise to citzens, only 52% of former British colonies do so.  Commonwealth clauses are found in [[Australia]], [[Barbados]], Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tabago, and Britain itself.  [[Ireland]] also extends the right to vote to citizens of Britain though not to other members of the British Commonwealth.
