'''Median Ratings''' is a [[voting system]] used for single-seat elections.  It is like [[Cardinal Ratings]] except that the candidate with the highest [[median]] score, rather than the highest total score, is elected.

==Example==
{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Suppose that voters were told to grant 1 to 4 points to each city such that their most liked choice(s) got 4 points, and least liked choice(s) got 1 point.

<table border="1">
   <tr>
      <th>City</th>
      <th>Memphis</th>
      <th>Nashville</th>
      <th>Chattanooga</th>
      <th>Knoxville</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>"4" votes</th>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>26</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>17</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>"3" votes</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>43</td>
      <td>15</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>"2" votes</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>32</td>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>26</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>"1" votes</th>
      <td>58</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>42</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Median</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
   </tr>
</table>

There is a tie between Nashville and Chattanooga.

==Advantages==

The main advantages of using the median instead of the sum or arithmetic mean of the individual ratings are:
*The result is determined by majorities: when a majority specifies a ranking at least a, then the median is also at least a, and when a majority specifies a ranking at most a, then the median is also at most a.
*The resulting method possesses many more and more natural-looking [[group strategy equilibria]] than [[Cardinal Ratings]] in the case of a [[sincere Condorcet Winner]]. 

==Disadvantages==

The example illustates one of the major flaws of Median Ratings.  Because the [[median]], by definition, is either the value of a single rating or the average of two ratings, there are very few possible values for a median score, and this makes ties much more likely than in [[Cardinal Ratings]].

Another problem with Median Ratings is its failure of the [[Blank Ballot Criterion]].  For example, with the ballots

* A=1, B=4
* A=2, B=4
* A=8, B=4
* A=9, B=4

A (median rating=5) beats B (median rating=4), but if the ballot (A=0, B=0) is added, then A's median rating drops to 2, causing B to win.
