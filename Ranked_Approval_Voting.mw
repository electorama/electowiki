'''Ranked Approval Voting''' (RAV) is one heuristic for finding the [[Definite Majority Choice]] winner. Kevin Venzke may have been the first to suggest it on the election methods mailing list, in September 2003. It was given the name "Ranked Approval Voting" by Russ Paielli.

== Ballot Format ==

To implement RAV, a voter uses a [[Preferential voting|ranked ballot]].  By default, any ranked candidates are considered approved.   Depending on implementation, the voter may also add an [[Approval Cutoff|approval cutoff]] to indicate that some of the ranked candidates are not approved.

== Procedure ==

Ballots are tabulated into a [[Condorcet_method#Counting_with_matrices|pairwise matrix]].

Repeat until a winner is found:
* Search for a candidate who is not defeated by any other non-eliminated candidates.  If one is found, this is the RAV winner..
* If no RAV winner exists, the candidate with the least approval is eliminated &mdash;his pairwise contests are no longer considered.

The process repeats until some non-eliminated candidate pairwise defeats every other non-eliminated candidate.

Ranked Approval Voting is a '''[[Condorcet method]]''', which means it always finds the [[Condorcet Criterion|Condorcet winner]] if one exists.  A Condorcet winner is the candidate who, when compared in turn with each of the other candidates, is preferred by more voters to the other candidate.  This implies that a majority of ballots rank the CW above any other candidate.

== Advantages ==

Ranked Approval Voting satisfies the [[Smith set|Smith criterion]] without requiring an explicit step to reduce to the Smith set.
