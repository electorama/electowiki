There are two ways to file a bug:

# On this page, below - while this project is in its infancy, this is an easy and useful way to report bugs.  Over time, it'll become less reliable, but for now, it works great.
#  On http://bugs.electorama.com (Bugzilla bug tracker).  This is more robust, but a bigger pain.  Still, it's the best way to file a bug you really care about, since you can get email notification when the status changes.  You can link to bugs in the bugtracker by simply using a wiki link to the bug number prepended by "Electobug", like this: [[Electobug:1]]


== Bugs / Feature requests ==
