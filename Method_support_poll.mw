Method support poll. Anyone with an interest in voting methods is welcome to participate. Do not alter the entries of any other participant.
In this context, "supporting" a method means that you would an effort to adopt this method in the place of a method that you don't "support". If you oppose a method, that means that you might attempt to prevent the adoption of that method, even as a replacement for a method not on your "support" list. There is no need to list ''every'' method that you oppose; just those that you think are worth mentioning, i.e. at least somewhat controversial.
Feel free to rank your supported methods in order of preference, or supply some other kind of comparison between them.
