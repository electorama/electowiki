Method support poll. Anyone with an interest in voting methods is welcome to participate. Do not alter the entries of any other participant.
In this context, "supporting" a method means that you would support an effort to adopt this method in the place of a method that you don't "support". If you oppose a method, that means that you might attempt to prevent the adoption of that method, even as a replacement for a method not on your "support" list. There is no need to list ''every'' method that you oppose; just those that you think are worth mentioning, i.e. at least somewhat controversial.
Feel free to rank your supported methods in order of preference, or supply some other kind of comparison between them. Feel free also to modify your answers at any time; there is no closing date for the poll.


==Single winner election methods==

'''Which single-winner election methods do you support for the election of government officials?''' Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that you support the method for local, state, and federal elections.


*'''James Green-Armytage'''
 '''Support:''' [[cardinal pairwise]] with [[beatpath]], [[ranked pairs]], 
 [[river]], or [[sequential dropping|Smith sequential dropping]], [[CWP|AWP]], [[Candidate withdrawal option|CWO-IRV]],
 [[ER-IRV|ER-IRV(whole)]], [[Approval voting]], [[ER-IRV|ER-IRV(fractional)]], [[IRV]]
 '''Close to supporting:''' [[Definite Majority Choice|DMC]]/[[Ranked Approval Voting|RAV]], [[Smith//IRV]], [[CDTT|CDTT,IRV]], [[Smith//minimax]]
 '''Oppose:''' [[Borda count]]
 '''Close to opposing:''' [[Minimax|minmax]], [[MMPO]], [[Bucklin]], [[Descending Acquiescing Coalitions]]

*'''Kevin Venzke'''
 ''In general I prefer methods without [[favorite betrayal]] incentive. I ''
 ''insist on [[Minimal Defense criterion|minimal defense]] or something similar.''
 '''Support:''' [[ICA]], [[Approval voting]]
 '''Close to supporting:''' [[Schulze method|Schulze]], Tideman, or River (using winning votes 
  or possibly [[cardinal pairwise|AWP]]), [[ER-Bucklin]](whole), [[MAMPO]], [[MDDA]]
 '''Support for legislatures only:''' [[CDTT]]-[[Later-no-harm criterion|Later-no-harm]] combination methods
 '''Oppose:''' [[plurality voting|plurality]], [[IRV]], [[ER-IRV]], margins, [[Borda count|Borda]],
  [[DSC]], rating ballots

*'''Juho Laatu'''
 '''Support:'''
 [[Condorcet Criterion|Condorcet]]: best for contentious elections if burying threat considered not too bad
 [[Minmax|Minmax(margins)]]: my default reference point, good utility function, strategy resistance 
 maybe not that bad
 Path based ([[Schulze method|Schulze]] etc.) and winning votes: ok but lots of work for small 
 improvements/changes (that are not all positive)
 Pairwise comparison methods enhanced with additional approval or rating information: ok as well if 
 not too complex for the voters
 [[Approval voting|Approval]]: clean method and at least some improvement to the commonly user 
 methods
 Best [[IRV]] methods (if pairwise comparison based methods are out of question)
 '''Close to supporting:''' [[Runoff voting|Two round system]] (not that bad for multiparty countries)
 '''Not supporting:''' Rating based methods (maybe not feasible for contentious elections like the 
 government official elections of this query, but good for non-contentious elections)
 '''Oppose:'''
 [[plurality voting|Plurality]] (except that it is ok for two party countries IF they want to stay 
 that way)
 Regional winner gets all votes of that region
 [[Borda count|Borda]] and many other ("more heuristic") methods

*'''David Gamble'''
  '''Support:''' [[IRV]]
  '''Close to supporting:'''[[Condorcet Criterion|Condorcet]]- any completion method, [[top-two runoff]].
  '''An improvement on [[Plurality]]:''' [[Approval voting]], [[Bucklin]], [[Range voting]].
  '''Close to opposing:''' [[Borda count|Borda]].
  '''Oppose:''' [[Plurality]], the use of single seat methods in multi-member districts.

*'''Mike Ossipoff'''
 '''Support:''' [[SSD, and Methods that meet FBC]]. These include [[Approval]], [[Range Voting]], [[MDDA]], [[MDDB]],
 [[MDD,ER-Bucklin(whole)]], and [[MAMPO]].
 
 '''Oppose:''' [[methods other than SSD that don't meet FBC]]
 
 (I'm referring to what I'd support or propose when a proposal is being chosen, not what I'd
 support or oppose after it has been put to the public).


*'''[[User:Allens|Allen Smith]]'''
 '''Support:''' [[Approval voting]], [[Approval-Condorcet Hybrids]], [[Condorcet//Approval]] and variants (e.g.,
 [[Improved Condorcet Approval]]).
 '''Close to supporting:''' [[Condorcet Criterion|Condorcet]] - any completion method, provided the result is a member
 of the [[Schwartz set]].
 '''Close to opposing:''' [[Borda count|Borda]]
 '''Oppose:''' [[Plurality]], [[Random Ballot]]

==Legislative election methods==

'''Which legislative (multi-winner) election methods do you support for the election of government officials?''' Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that you support the method for local, state, and federal elections.


*'''James Green-Armytage'''
 '''Support:''' [[CPO-STV]], [[single transferable vote]]
 '''Close to opposing:''' [[Cumulative voting]], [[limited voting]], [[SNTV]]
 '''Conditional support:''' Support [[Party-list proportional representation|party list]] as a transitional system in some cases where 
 infrastructure is limited, and where a large part of the population lacks the numerical 
 literacy skills need for an STV vote.

*'''Kevin Venzke'''
 '''Support:''' open party list (approval component), closed party list, 
 possibly a proportional approval scheme

*'''Juho Laatu'''
 '''Support:'''
 Open party list enhanced with hierarchical structure
 [[Open list|Open party list]]
 [[STV]] (non-party-based votes are both good and bad)
 Regional representation (various styles to complement other methods)
 '''Close to supporting:''' [[Closed list|Closed party list]], [[CPO-STV]] (complexity problems)
 '''Not supporting:''' Two party methods (ok if kept intentionally, not just because of fear of 
 changes or to stay in power)

*'''David Gamble'''
 '''Support:''' [[single transferable vote]], [[CPO-STV]].
 '''Close to supporting:''' Any other proportional method - open party list,
  closed party list, semi-open party list, [[MMP]].
 '''Improvement on single seats methods for multi-member
 bodies:'''[[SNTV]], [[Limited vote]], [[Cumulative voting]].
 '''Oppose:''' Single seat methods for multi-member bodies in single 
  seats,single seat methods in multi-member districts.
