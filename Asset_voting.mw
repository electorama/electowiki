Asset voting is used to refer to a voting system in which votes are considered as "assets" given to candidates. If no candidate gets more than the winning threshold (ie, a majority, in the [[Single-winner voting system|single winner]] case), then the candidates can redistribute "their" votes to other candidates until a winner exists. Variations exist with different constraints on transfers - for example, the candidate with the fewest votes might be forced to redistribute their votes first.

Asset voting was invented in 1874 by [[Lewis Caroll]] (Charles Dodgson), and independently reinvented and named by Forest Simmons and Warren Smith. <ref>[http://www.rangevoting.org/AssetCLD.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.rangevoting.org/BlackCarrollAER2.pdf Duncan Black: Lewis Carroll and the Theory of Games, The American Economic Review 59,2 (May 1969) 206-210]</ref> 

If used as a [[Voting_systems#Multiple-winner_methods|multi-winner voting method]], it obeys most [[proportionality criteria]], if the requisite assumptions about coalitions are extended to include candidates as well as voters. In such use, it is similar to [[delegable proxy]] systems except that, unlike such systems, it has public elections only at regularly scheduled intervals (proxies are not "revocable") and elects a fixed number of representatives with equal power.
