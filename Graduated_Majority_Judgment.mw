Like its predecessor [[Majority Judgment]], '''Continuous Majority Judgment''' or '''CMJ''' is a single-winner, median-based voting system. It works as follows:

# Each voter grades each candidate on a grading scale such as A, B, C, D, F
# Each grade for each candidate is tallied.
# The tallies are used to find the median grade for each candidate.
# Tallies are added to find the V(>M), V(@M), and V(>M) (that is, votes above median, votes at median, and votes below median or blank) for each candidate.
# A candidate's adjustment is a number between -0.5 and +0.5, calculated using the formula (V(>M) - V(<M)) / (2 * V(@M))
# The candidate with the highest adjustment among those with the highest median, wins.
