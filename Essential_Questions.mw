''This is under construction and will be announced soon on EM-list.''

This is a dynamic list of possible statements about what election methods should be like.
It is meant to give a survey of the EM list members' basic opinions.

Each person can add their own column and express their degree of agreement below each of the statements. For reasons of space, please just put your initials in the column's head. 

When you add a new statement about some essential property of election methods, please try to formulate it as clear as possible, using as few ambiguous terms as possible, and keep the list sorted by groups of related statements.

Please do not change the wording of statements as soon as someone expressed a degree of agreement. If you do, please announce on EM list, add a new line of degrees of agreement and put the old line of degrees of agreement in brackets. 


== Degrees of agreement ==
 
 ++  I agree strongly
  +  I rather agree
  0  I am indifferent about this
  -  I rather disagree
 --  I disagree strongly
 
  ?  I am undecided about this
