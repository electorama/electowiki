Simple Optionally-Delegated Approval (SODA) is a single-winner voting system based on [[approval voting]]. As in approval voting, voters get a ballot which lets them vote for as many or as few candidates as they like. Unlike in approval, voters who don't want to decide yes or no for every candidate can choose to delegate their ballot, trusting their favorite candidate to "complete the ballot" by deciding which others to approve. The voters' ballots are counted and the totals are announced, and then candidates can choose to exercise the ballots delegated to them. At that point, candidates who do not expect to win can use the delegated ballots they hold to approve others whom they think would be good compromise options.

After all candidates exercise their delegated ballots, the winner is the candidate with the most approvals.

== Procedure ==
=== Overview ===
For simplicity, the ballot is organized like an approval ballot. It is assumed that voters who vote for only one candidate are intending to delegate their ballot to that candidate, unless they explicitly indicate otherwise using a "do not delegate" option. Thus, no voter's ballot is delegated without their consent.

Candidates are required to submit a rank-ordering of all the other candidates before the election. This serves two purposes. First, it helps voters understand how that candidate might choose to complete their delegated ballots. A voter who supports a candidate but disagrees with their rankings of others can complete their ballot themselves instead of delegating. Second, the prior rankings vastly decrease the opportunities for manipulation when the candidates exercise their ballots. When they exercise the ballots delegated to them, the candidates must approve others in a way that is consistent with the rank-ordering they submitted. In other words, they must take their submitted rank-ordering and choose a cutoff point, approving all candidates above that point and disapproving all candidates below that point. Thus, they cannot simply sell their delegated votes to the highest bidder.

To further decrease the opportunities for manipulation, candidates with the most approvals get the advantage of "moving first" in declaring how they will exercise their delegated ballots. This order is designed to encourage good outcomes in certain problematic situations. See below for more information.

=== Full, step-by-step rules ===

'''1. Candidates publicly declare their rankings of the other candidates'''

A) Before the election, all candidates must rank the other official candidates in order of preference. Equal rankings and truncation are allowed. The candidates' rankings are all made public. Later, in the "candidate voting" step, candidates may only approve other candidates in a way that is consistent with their rankings. This helps reduce the possibility of corrupt vote-selling or "smoke filled rooms". 

B) It is presumed that there is some mechanism in place so that no candidate is "caught off-guard" by another candidate's rankings. For instance, there could be an option for a candidate to change their rankings after another candidate has announced their own rankings. That is, if A and B agree to rank each other for delegation, but then after A ranks B, B reneges on the agreement by ranking A last, A could retaliate by moving B to the last ranking. The details of such a mechanism are unimportant, because its very existence would prevent it from being used; candidates, realizing that surprises don't work and only cause resentment, wouldn't attempt to use them.

'''2. Voters vote delegable plurality-style votes or non-delegable approval-style votes'''

A) Each voter submits an approval ballot.

B) Any "bullet vote" - that is, a ballot which votes for only one candidate - is considered a "delegable vote" for a candidate, unless the voter indicates that it should not be delegable. These votes are tallied for each candidate.

C) Approval totals for each candidate are also tallied. These preliminary results are announced, along with the number of "delegable votes" each candidate has.

D) If any candidate has an absolute majority at this point, or cannot possibly be beaten by any other candidate using the delegable votes and candidate rankings available, then they win immediately.

'''3. Candidates complete the votes delegated to them, publicly, in the prescribed order'''

A) There is a brief period - perhaps a week - for candidates to analyse and negotiate based on these preliminary results. (Actually, the correct strategies for all candidates and the resulting winner will already be obvious. Usually, all candidates except this winner would concede as soon as preliminary results are announced. However, for the occasional candidate inclined to act irrationally in a way that matters - say, by not delegating to an ally, even though the alternative is to see an enemy elected - this interim period would give them a chance to rethink things and come into reason.)

B) All candidates, in descending order of the number of total votes they have, choose how to the votes delegated to them. To do so, they choose a cutoff candidate, and approve all others whom they had ranked above that cutoff. They may choose the top of their ranking list as the cutoff - that is, not approve any other candidates. They may not approve all other candidates, as that would require choosing a cutoff who was worse than all candidates including themselves. If they declared a tie in their preferences, they must either approve all candidates whom they included in that tie (as well as anyone they ranked above that), or none of them. (Note: Doing this in descending order prevents a weaker candidate from making an ultimatum to a stronger candidate, and thus strengthens the strategic equilibrium of any pairwise champion there is.) These choices are announced publicly as they are made.

B)i) Write-in candidates could not receive delegated votes, but could be approved at will by official candidates, regardless of declared ranking order. 

C) The number of delegated votes held by each candidate is added to the approval total of everyone they approved.

'''4. Highest total wins'''

=== Optional rules ===
==== Prevent sliver candidates from having kingmaker power ====

Optional step 2.C.ii. (applied after step 2.C above): If any candidate has less than 5% (of the total votes) as delegable votes, and is not one of the top two in total votes, then those votes are automatically delegated down their preference list as far as the Condorcet winner (considering known ballots and preference orders) among the candidates on their preference list, or, in case of elections with a cycle, as far as the second member of the Smith set (this is correct CPNE strategy for a Smith set of size 3; larger Smith sets, with over two members included in the minor candidate's preference list, are hit-by-lightning unlikely).

(Note: extending delegation as far as the Condorcet winner, instead of the candidate just before the Condorcet winner, may not be correct strategy if the Condorcet winner does not need their votes. However, by definition this will not make any practical difference if other candidates use correct strategy, and even if it did it would tend to be a socially-beneficial one. Also, the rule as stated is simpler and more decisive. Candidates with more than 5% would not need to worry about this issue. Neither should readers who don't understand this paragraph.)

This rule would help make this system more attractive to major-party politicians. But it's a principled rule, not just a sop to the major parties. Consider the "kingmaker" case: in a basically 50/50 split, some tiny party has the balance of votes, and manages to extract concessions far bigger than their base of support justifies, just in order to delegate those votes or not. That's unjust, and this rule would prevent it. 

This rule is recommended if SODA is to be instituted by legislation (where politicians' support is important), and not recommended if it is to be instituted by initiative/plebiscite (where simplicity is more important).

5% is a good cutoff here; that's tens of millions of voters nationally, and enough to deserve a voice. It shouldn't be too high, because this rule is effectively taking power away from voters; that's only justified if the faction is so small that the power is not legitimate, and so it's better to err a bit on the small side if anything. But under 5% - that is, under 10% of the winning coalition - doesn't deserve kingmaker power.

==== Runoff if there's a majority failure ====
In some jurisdictions, a runoff may be constitutionally required if no candidate gets an absolute majority of approvals. This is compatible with SODA. Runoffs would in general be rare, because if voters wish to avoid one, they can ensure that any pairwise champion wins without needing a runoff. In fact, because it can obtain a majority even if most voters bullet vote for different candidates, '''SODA may lead to an absolute majority ''more'' often than IRV'''. IRV is often promoted as guaranteeing a majority, but this only applies if there is a rule to force all voters to rank all candidates; Australia has traditionally had such a rule but it is unpopular, and it would be a total non-starter in the US or UK. Without such a rule, non-majority IRV results are in fact relatively frequent.

(Wonkish note: in the unlikely case that there is no pairwise champion, rational strategy would make runoffs even less likely; the correct strategy with a 3-member Smith set is for each candidate to approve two of the members, which would tend to leave at least one of the candidates with over 2/3 of all delegated votes, plus a good fraction of the non-delegated votes; well over 50% overall in any case. Correct strategy for larger Smith sets is more complicated, but it frequently amounts to using this same two-of-the-three strategy for the first Condorcet triangle which is spanned by the delegated vote declaration order. If this is greek to you, don't worry, it doesn't matter; you'd probably have a "3 member Smith set" well under than 10% of the time, the and a larger one far less than 1% of the time. Even if it did matter, the concrete example would be much easier to understand than this mathematical jargon, and the voters wouldn't have to deal with it anyway.)

== Sample Ballot ==

'''Vote for as many candidates as you approve:'''<br>
&#9634; Candidate A (will not share votes)<br>
&#9634; Candidate B (Prefers A, then C and D)<br>
&#9634; Candidate C (Prefers D)<br>
&#9634; Candidate D (Prefers C)<br>
&#9634; ____(write-in)____<br>
&#9634; ____(write-in)____<br>
&#9634; ____(write-in)____<br>
&#9634; ____(write-in)____

'''If you only vote for one candidate, he or she can choose to share your vote with one or more others from the top of his or her preference list. If that happens, it will be counted as if you had also checked those candidates above. You can stop this from happening by checking the box below:'''<br>
&#9634; Do not let the candidate I voted for share my vote with other candidates.<br>
''Note: if you vote for more than one candidate, none of them can share your vote, and it does not matter whether you check the box above.''

== Example ==

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

In this simplified example, all the residents of each city agree on the rankings of all the other cities, so there would be no reason for anybody to do anything but bullet vote. Memphis has the first option to delegate, and, as the leader, decides not to. Nashville goes second; it is the pairwise champion (Condorcet winner), so it also declines to delegate any of its votes. Chatanooga and Knoxville would delegate to each other and to Nashville, to prevent Memphis from winning. Nashville would then be the winner, with 58% approval after delegation.

Chatanooga could, before the election, not include Nashville in its preference list, hoping to force Nashville to delegate to it. But in that case Memphis would delegate to Nashville to prevent Nashville from being forced to hand the election to Chatanooga, and so Nashville would win with an even larger majority. Therefore, Chatanooga will not attempt this.

== Criteria Compliance ==

SODA satisfies [[monotonicity]], the [[majority criterion]], the [[mutual majority criterion]], the [[independence of clones criterion]]. Depending on assumptions and definitions, it can pass the [[Condorcet loser criterion]].

It does not satisfy the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion in general, but it does if the "irrelevant alternative" is assumed to delegate votes in the same way as any candidate whose delegable votes they supplant. Similarly, it can only pass the [[participation]] and [[consistency]] criteria if it is assumed that candidate delegations do not change. These assumptions are ''not'' realistic, but they do show that the method is in some sense "close to" passing these criteria.

It fails the [[Condorcet criterion]], although the majority Condorcet winner over the ranking-augmented ballots is the unique strong equilibrium winner. That is to say that, under the realistic but not inviolable assumptions that candidates are honest in their pre-election rankings (not innately, but in because dishonesty would lose them votes) and strategic in their actions, and that the voters are able to use the system to express all relevant preferences, the method would in fact pass the majority Condorcet winner criterion.

== Advantages ==
# SODA is arguably better than Plurality voting in every way (Pareto dominant). Although other systems may offer even-greater advantages over plurality, they also come with certain disadvantages. Those disadvantages may be minor, but a supporter of such a system must waste time looking defensive in order to convince voters of that. A SODA advocate can devote all their time to talking up its advantages.
# SODA is extremely easy for the voters; in fact, no voting system is simpler to vote. (Plurality, by restricting you to only one vote, also makes it possible to mistakenly "overvote", spoiling your ballot. There is no such way to accidentally invalidate your ballot under SODA. Also, both Plurality and Approval require a conscientious voter to consider strategy and polling status; SODA allows a simple bullet vote to still be strategically as strong as possible, regardless of the candidate standings.)
# All the steps of SODA have a clear purpose. Instead of relying on complicated rules to give a good outcome, SODA gives simple tools to the people involved, so that a good outcome is simply the rational result.
# There is no motivation for dishonesty from individual voters. A voter can safely vote for any candidate that they honestly agree with, without fear of that vote being wasted; or safely vote an honest approval-style ballot, if they do not agree with any candidate's preference order.
# Any vote delegation is entirely optional. Any voter who dislikes the idea of their vote being delegated in a "smoke-filled room", need not allow that to happen.
# SODA is far more likely to arrive at a majority result than Plurality (or even IRV). It may even be more likely to give a Condorcet winner than a Condorcet system.
# Assuming that all voters who choose to delegate their vote agree with the declared preference order of their candidate, and assuming that approval ballots are enough to express the relevant preferences of all voters who do not cast a delegable ballot, then any pairwise champion (Condorcet winner) will be a known, strong equilibrium winner. That means that, if all candidates delegate their votes rationally, no coalition of candidates can elect anybody they all prefer to the natural winner, the candidate who could beat all others one-on-one. (This is simply due to the well-known result that a CW is a [[Strong Nash equilibrium]] winner under Approval.) 
# Leaders of minority factions would have an appropriate voice for their concerns, although power would ultimately reside with any majority coalition which exists.
# This should be generally acceptable to current politicians, who are winners in a Plurality two-party system. Plurality-style voting still works just fine, and if most votes are for major parties, this system will cleanly allow a major party to win, in many cases without going to the delegation round (especially if the major-party candidates do not pre-announce delegation preferences, thus preventing an extorting minor party from demanding their delegated votes; or if the optional anti-kingmaker rule is used).

== Criticism and responses ==
=== "There are other systems which are better in some ways." ===

This is true. Condorcet, Range Voting, and Median systems (MJ, MCA, or Bucklin) each have some claim to be the "best voting system". But SODA is the best system which has no downsides versus plurality. All those other systems require more-complicated ballots. All of them require more-complicated, or even dishonest, strategic decisions from the voter, to get the most effective vote.

So in the end, while any of the systems I mentioned would be, in my opinion, a clear net benefit versus plurality, with SODA you don't need my opinion or any qualifications like "'''net''' benefit". It is simply better, in every way.

=== "Allowing a candidate to delegate your vote could lead corrupt back-room deals, not the voters' will, to determine the outcome" ===
Simple response: if you don't want a candidate to delegate your vote, don't make your vote delegable.

Also, since candidate's delegations must accord with their pre-declared preferences, there no opportunity for strategy as long as those preferences were honestly-declared. And the preferences do not represent back-room wheeling and dealing; they are public positions. The various risks of dishonestly declaring one's preference clearly outweigh the unlikely benefits they'd give.

Simple response to a ''candidate'' who makes this argument: "He just wants the only smoke-filled room to be the one inside his skull." That is, minority factions '''should''' have a seat at the table, as long as everything is done transparently. In SODA, all vote totals, preference orders, and final delegation decisions are known; in the end, that's not a smoke-filled room, it's a transparent seat at the table, with a just degree of power which is derived from the people.

=== "Why go to the trouble of pre-announced rankings and a second round? Why not just have candidates pre-announce their delegated approvals?" ===

This sounds appealing, but would not work if two similar candidates were in a close race to see which had more first-choice votes, while an opponent stood ready to take advantage if they split the vote. The system as it stands allows the similar candidates to see, after the votes are counted, which of them deserves to win: the one with the higher approval total. That one will go first and not delegate their votes, and then other one (of necessity) will.

In general, this system, because it provides perfect information on voting totals at the time when delegation is happening, will make strategy obvious. (The pairwise champion/Condorcet winner is a strong Nash equilibrium; and even if there are 3 or 4 candidates in the Smith set, there is still a unique Coalition Proof Nash Equilibrium). This has the paradoxical result that, as long as most voters agree with their favored candidate's chosen ranking order (or as long as there are minor "delegator-only" candidates for every preference ordering of the majors which is held by a significant number of voters), this system will in practice be '''more Condorcet compliant than a Condorcet method''' (because strategy could confound a true Condorcet method, but delegation strategy in SODA is strongly attracted by a correct equilibrium).

== Opinionated sales pitches (hard sell) ==

One of SODA's advantages is that, more than almost any other system, it is compatible with either a two-party or a multiparty system.

While many are convinced that, in the long run, a multiparty system is healthier, it is still important for a voting system to compatible with two parties. Current politicians, winners under a two-party system, are in many cases the gatekeepers of reform. Yes, that's largely a case of the fox guarding the henhouse, but it's also a fact of life.

Here are the pitches one could make. Both of those pitches are feeding on the sicknesses inherent in a two-party duopoly. But that doesn't mean that SODA would feed those sicknesses or make them worse; it's just using those sicknesses to make an argument that is still ethically justified. Remember, SODA is fully compatible with a multiparty world; in fact, as argued above, it is in an important sense more Condorcet compliant than a Condorcet system.

=== For a politician (Democrat or Republican) ===

So, why is SODA compatible with two parties? Here's the kind of pitch you could make to a Republican or Democratic politician. This pitch is a "hard sell" aimed at the toughest audience: a dyed-in-the-wool partisan. As such, it includes some disingenuous trash talk about other good systems and about third parties or independents. If you were dealing with a more-reasonable person who could put the interests of democracy above their partisan interests, you would not pitch it this way. 

"SODA encourages most voters to vote for a single candidate, just as they do today. So an average joe, who wants to put as little thought as possible into his ballot, will still be voting for one of the major parties. With the large majority of ballots in the same two-party split as today, the minor parties will have essentially no choice but to delegate their vote to one of the majors, or relegate themselves to irrelevance. So all this will do is make it so that the Libertarians (for a Rebublican)/Greens (for a Democrat) are your allies, not spoilers.

"Any other system is more of a danger to you. You ever heard of a Condorcet Winner? No? Well, most systems try to elect a Condorcet Winner, and lemme tell you something: H. Ross Perot, that's what a Condorcet winner is. Somebody who comes up in the center, in between the two parties, and it doesn't matter how incompetent or unexperienced he is, because the Democratic voters prefer him to a Republican, and the Republican voters prefer him to a Democrat, so it doesn't matter, he could be two wheels short of a tricycle, there's still no way to beat him. Well, look at how SODA handles that. The Democrat and the Republican, they don't plan to delegate their votes, so they don't announce a preference order. And then it's pointless for the centrist, the Perot, to ask them to delegate their votes to him - they can't. So if the Perot guy wants to be in the game and delegate to someone - whoever he pre-announced before the election, if anybody - he can do that; if he wants to be just a protest candidate, he doesn't announce a delegation order up front, so he either wins or loses on his own. In the first case, he's just a minor candidate, like a Green or a Libertarian, and you don't have to worry about him any more than about them. In the second case, he's irrelevant, at worst a spoiler, just as under plurality. So either way, you're at least as well-off as you are today."

=== For a third-party voter ===

OK, maybe that was a little overboard. So here's a pitch for a third-party supporter, to balance it out.

"What do you want, in the end? People like you are in a minority, and I'm sure you realize that you won't take over the world overnight. So you want a fair hearing, you want a seat at the table. Most voting systems are just selling you dreams. One day, they say, you're going to convince a majority to join your team, and on that glorious day your team's gonna be in charge. How well has that worked for Republican and Democratic voters? How much important change do you see when the pendulum swings back and forth between those two parties? Not enough. The truth is, by the time you sway a majority, your big ideas are going to be watered down - and, what's worse, you're going to have to be pretending that the watered-down version is the real thing.

"But there's another option. You can keep having big ideas, and just have a system that doesn't shut you out of the room. There are a lot, a lot of people who aren't fully satisfied with 'their' party, who are looking for another option. Take off their two-party shackles, let them safely vote for someone else, and they'll jump at the chance. And there you will be, with 10, 15, 25% of the vote. No, that won't be enough to win, but it will darn well be enough to get some respect, to get your ideas a fair hearing, get some of them tried, which is what you need in order to grow. And if the major party supposedly on 'your' side doesn't listen, you will have the power to take those votes and go home. You know and I know that major party politicians, they call themselves leaders, but what they really are is cowards. When you're sitting on a double-digit pile of votes, they will listen to you, trust me."

== SODA-PR (proportional representation version of SODA) ==
SODA-PR is the [[proportional representation]] version of the above. 

First, to simplify the ballots, the population is separated into a "district" for each seat, and "districts" are grouped into sets of 2 or 3 "co-districts". The ballot for each district lists the candidates from that district in a larger font, and the candidates from its co-districts in a smaller font. Write-ins may be used to vote for candidates from other districts not listed on the ballot, so the districts only matter for ballot simplicity (Voters do not want to have a ballot with many dozens of candidates on it, but write-ins allow full freedom for those voters who want it). Larger parties will usually run one candidate per district; smaller parties may just run one candidate per co-district set.

As with SODA, voters can either vote an approval-style vote or delegate by bullet voting. Instead of a pre-announced ranking which allows them to choose a cutoff after the election, candidates have a pre-announced approval ballot that will be used automatically to complete any votes delegated to them (beyond the votes they need to be elected). Candidates may make their approval of other candidates conditional on that approval being mutual, but they may not make it conditional on anything else about the other candidate's approvals. Thus, parties cannot protect corrupt members by forcing other candidates in the party to approve of them. 

The counting process is as follows:

While there are more uneliminated candidates than empty seats:
*Divide each ballot by the number of uneliminated candidates it approves
*If there are any candidates with more than a Droop quota:
**Elect the one with the highest score (previously "unique ballots")
**Repeat...
***Discard a randomly-chosen [[Droop quota]] of ballots which approve the elected candidate, starting with the ones delegated to that candidate
***Check who the next candidate to be elected will be
***If the next candidate to be elected is not the same as the last time you checked, then re-add the just-discarded ballots and repeat this process
**...until the next candidate to be elected is the same twice in a row. (this effectively eliminates fluke results due to the randomness of the discard step. If voters tolerate "complicated" math better than they tolerate randomness, this step can be replaced with the equivalent fractional reweighting of ballots. Results should not differ either way.)
**Assign the elected candidate's pre-declared approvals on any undiscarded delegated ballots for that candidate
*Otherwise:
**Eliminate the candidate with the lowest score
**Assign the eliminated candidate's pre-declared approvals on any delegated ballots for that candidate
Elect all remaining candidates to fill the seats.

Note: If all votes are for one of the two main-party candidates in the voter's district, and if all candidates approve everyone from their party, and if the districts are divided fairly so that plurality would give a proportional result, SODA-PR gives the same results as plurality. These assumptions will not generally be perfectly true, but they will generally be close to true, so SODA-PR will give results that are recognizably similar to single-member districts. It is hoped that this would make it a more acceptable system to politicians who have won under single-winner rules.
