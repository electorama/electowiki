'''Immune set''':  ''The set of candidates such that any defeat against a candidate within the set is countered by a string of stronger (or equally strong) defeats leading back to the defeating candidate.'' 

There is an immune set definition for various possible defeat strength definition, e.g. the [[winning votes|WV]]-defined immune set, the [[margins]]-defined immune set, the [[CWP]]-defined immune set.

If there is a [[Condorcet method|Condorcet winner]], he or she is the only member of the immune set. In a three candidate cycle with unequal defeat strengths, the immune set has one member, i.e. the candidate with the weakest defeat against him or her. When defeats in a cycle have equal strength, or when the cycle is between more than three candidates, the immune set can have multiple members.

The immune set was proposed by Jobst Heitzig.
