== Ballot ==

Voters can express both strong and weak preferences. 

E.g. A ballot can be marked A>B>C>>D>E>F>>G.


== Tally ==

The direction of pairwise defeats are determined by both strong and weak preferences, and the strength of pairwise defeats are determined only by strong preferences. 

E.g. the A>B preference above is weak, the A>>D preference in the example above is strong, the D>F preference is weak, the F>>G preference is strong, etc.
