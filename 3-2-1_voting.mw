In 3-2-1 voting, voters may rate each candidate “Good”, “Acceptable”, or “Rejected”. It has three steps:

* Find 3 Semifinalists: the candidates with the most “good” ratings. (If this is a partisan election, no two semifinalists may come from the same party).
* Find 2 Finalists: the semifinalists with the fewest rejections.
* Find 1 winner: the finalist who is rated above the other on more ballots.

=== High school mascot (chicken dilemma) ===
Imagine an election for a high school mascot, in which the options are “Bulldogs”, “Lions”, “Tigers”, or “Knights”, with the following votes:

{| class="wikitable"
! Faction size
! "Good" candidates
! "Acceptable" candidates
! "Bad" candidates
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 36
| Bulldogs, Knights
| 
| Lions, Tigers
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 4
| Bulldogs
| Knights
| Lions, Tigers
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 35
| Tigers
| Lions
| Bulldogs, Knights
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 25
| Lions
| Tigers
| Bulldogs, Knights
|}

The votes above lead to the following outcome:

{| class="wikitable"
! Candidate
! "Good" ratings
! "Acceptable" ratings
! "Bad" ratings
! 2-way score
|-
| Lions
| bgcolor="#fcc"|25
