In 3-2-1 voting, voters may rate each candidate “Good”, “Acceptable”, or “Rejected”. It has three steps:

* Find 3 Semifinalists: the candidates with the most “good” ratings. (If this is a partisan election, no two semifinalists may come from the same party).
* Find 2 Finalists: the semifinalists with the fewest rejections.
* Find 1 winner: the finalist who is rated above the other on more ballots.

== Motivation for each step ==

Step 1: A winner should have strong support; at least some voters who have paid attention and are enthusiastic. But if you keep fewer than 3 at this stage, you'd risk prematurely eliminating a centrist and leaving only the two extremes.

Step 2: This allows a majority of the electorate to have a veto on any candidate. Also, candidates that are eliminated here would usually have little chance in step 3 anyway.

Step 3: This is like a runoff between the two strongest candidates. If you know which two candidates will be finalists, you have no incentive not to rank them honestly, and everybody who made a distinction between them gets equal voting power.

== Properties ==

This system satisfies the [[Majority criterion]]; the [[Condorcet Loser criterion]]; [[monotonicity]]; and [[local independence of irrelevant alternatives]].

It satisfies the [[mutual majority criterion]] as long as any member of the mutual majority set of candidates is among the 3 semifinalists. In practice, this is almost guaranteed to be the case.

Steps 1 and 3 satisfy the [[later no-harm criterion]], so that the only strategic reason not to add any "acceptable" ratings would be if your favorite was one of the two most-rejected semifinalists but also was able to beat the least-rejected semifinalist in step 3. This combination of weak and strong is unlikely to happen in real life, and even less likely to be predictable enough a priori to be a basis for strategy.

=== Tennessee capital (center squeeze) ===

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

This leads to the following outcome:

{| class="wikitable"
! Candidate
! "Good" ratings
! "Acceptable" ratings
! "Bad" ratings
! 2-way score
|-
| Memphis
| bgcolor="#cfc"|42
| bgcolor="#beb"|0
|bgcolor="#faa"| 58
| bgcolor="#fcc"| 
|-
| Nashville
| bgcolor="#cfc"| 26
| bgcolor="#beb"|74
| bgcolor="#cfc"|0
| bgcolor="#cfc"|68
|-
| Chattanooga
| bgcolor="#faa"|  15
| bgcolor="#ebb"|85
| bgcolor="#fcc"|0
| bgcolor="#fcc"|
|-
| Knoxville
| bgcolor="#cfc"|  17
| bgcolor="#beb"| 41
| bgcolor="#cfc"|42
| bgcolor="#faa"|32
|}

The three most-endorsed are Memphis (42), Nashville (26), and Knoxville (17). Of those three, the two least-rejected are Nashville (0 rejections) and Knoxville (42 rejections). Of those two, Nashville is preferred by 68 to 32.

=== High school mascot (chicken dilemma) ===
Imagine an election for a high school mascot, in which the options are “Bulldogs”, “Lions”, “Tigers”, or “Knights”, with the following votes:

{| class="wikitable"
! Faction size
! "Good" candidates
! "Acceptable" candidates
! "Bad" candidates
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 20
| Bulldogs, Knights
| 
| Lions, Tigers
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 20
| Bulldogs
| Knights
| Lions, Tigers
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 35
| Tigers
| Lions
| Bulldogs, Knights
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | 25
| Lions
| Tigers
| Bulldogs, Knights
|}

The votes above lead to the following outcome:

{| class="wikitable"
! Candidate
! "Good" ratings
! "Acceptable" ratings
! "Bad" ratings
! 2-way score
|-
| Lions
| bgcolor="#cfc"|25
| bgcolor="#beb"|35
|bgcolor="#cfc"| 40
| bgcolor="#faa"| 25
|-
| Tigers
| bgcolor="#cfc"| 35
| bgcolor="#beb"|25
| bgcolor="#cfc"|40
| bgcolor="#cfc"|35
|-
| Knights
| bgcolor="#faa"|  20
| bgcolor="#ebb"|20
| bgcolor="#fcc"|60
| bgcolor="#fcc"|
|-
| Bulldogs
| bgcolor="#cfc"|  40
| bgcolor="#beb"| 0
| bgcolor="#faa"|60
| bgcolor="#fcc"|
|}

The semifinalists are Lions, Tigers, and Bulldogs. The finalists are Lions and Tigers. The winner is Tigers.
