In 3-2-1 voting, voters may rate each candidate “Good”, “Acceptable”, or “Rejected”. It has three steps:

* Find 3 Semifinalists: the candidates with the most “good” ratings. (If this is a partisan election, no two semifinalists may come from the same party).
* Find 2 Finalists: the semifinalists with the fewest rejections.
* Find 1 winner: the finalist who is rated above the other on more ballots.
