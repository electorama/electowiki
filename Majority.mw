A '''simple majority''' is the most common requirement in voting for a measure to pass, especially in deliberative bodies and small organizations.  It means that, of those who cast a vote for or against a proposition or candidate, more than half of the votes is necessary for election.

As an example, let's consider three propositions: A, B, and C, that are proposed in a club of 100 members.  In order for a proposition to be successful, a simple majority must agree to it.  The results of the election are:
* 20 votes for proposition A
* 40 votes for proposition B
* 10 votes for proposition C
* 10 votes are blank

Since there are more votes for B than there are votes for both A and C combined, B has the simple majority, and so wins.  Notice that abstentions and non-voters do not affect a simple majority process, since they neither support nor oppose.  They only affect an [[absolute majority]].

In an election for president in the same club having candidates Jim, Bob, Sally, and Bridget, the results are as follows:
* 20 votes for Jim
* 20 votes for Bob
* 40 votes for Sally
* 2 votes for Bridget

In this election, no one has more votes than the combined votes of the opponents, so no one wins.  In a case like this, most systems would either adopt a [[plurality]] rule or would have a second [[runoff election]].

Tie votes do not meet simple majority and are classfied as failures.
