This is the official homepage for the '''election-methods mailing list'''.

On "election-methods-list", we discuss the nitty-gritty
details of single-winner election reform, the relative merits of different
proportional representation systems, and the technical underpinnings of
all election methods. "election-methods-list" discussions
tend to be technical in nature (or at least, very laden with jargon), with the ultimate goal of
providing recommendations and educational material to the electoral reform movement.

Those that want
to have in-depth discussions about the technical subtleties of election
methods can use "election-methods-list" to discuss those things without
fear of reprisal from those who aren't interested.

== Code of Conduct ==

Please come prepared to defend the statements that you make,
and to directly answer the questions that others ask of you. This list
was set up to increase communication between people interested in new forms
of election methodology, not as a sounding board for those who wish to
drown out opposing views with prolific repetition of statements already
made. When conflicts arise, please use this list to understand ''fully''
why the other side feels the way they do by honest intellectual inquiry.
And when those who feel differently than you are trying to understand why
you feel the way you do, please answer as honestly and directly as possible.

Hopefully this is all common sense, but sadly not common enough (hence
the reason for this message). In summary, please ask, answer, and be humble.
