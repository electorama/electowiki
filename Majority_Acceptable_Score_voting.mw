Majority Acceptable Score voting works as described below. Technically speaking, it's the [[graded Bucklin]] method which uses [[3 grade levels]] and breaks median ties using [[Score voting]].

* Voters can give each candidate 0, 1, or 2 points. 
* All candidates given 0 by a majority are eliminated, if any others would remain. 
** (If there are any candidates given 2 by a majority, you should eliminate any who aren't. But a majority-2 candidate would probably win in the next step anyway, so this step is probably superfluous. It's just included because it's part of Bucklin voting, which was used in over a dozen US cities, and thus it gives this method a stronger pedigree.) 
* The remaining candidate with the highest points wins.

Blank votes are counted as 1 or 0 points in proportion to the fraction of all voters who gave the candidate a 2. For example, a candidate could not win with more than 71% blank votes, because even if the other 29% are all 2-ratings, that would leave 71%*71%=50.41% 0-votes, enough to eliminate.

Here's a google spreadsheet to calculate results: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1siFG6XmOZokygY-86EhAKgv8YwzKtTET6AJopyXRqu0/edit#gid=0]. On page 1, it has some examples of how different combinations of ratings would come out, suggesting that it could work well in both [[chicken dilemma]] and [[center squeeze]] scenarios. On page 2, it has some hypothetical results for the Egypt 2012 election, showing that this system could have elected a reformer over Morsi, despite vote-splitting among the various reformers. IRV could have elected Morsi.

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Assume voters in each city give their own city 2; any city within 100 miles, 1; any city that is over 200 miles away or is the farthest city, 0; and the rest (those between 100 and 200 miles), get 0 or 1 with 50/50 chance.

Memphis and Knoxville are both given 0 by a majority, so they are eliminated. Of the remaining two, Nashville has a higher score and wins.

If Memphis voters rated Nashville at 0 in the above scenario, they could cause Memphis to win. But Chattanooga and Knoxville voters could protect against this as long as at least 3/4 of them (24% from their combined total of 32%) gave Nashville a 1 (or a 2).
