Majority Acceptable Score voting works as described below. Technically speaking, it's the [[graded Bucklin]] method which uses [[3 grade levels]] and breaks median ties using [[Score voting]].

* Voters rate candidates 0, 1, or 2. 
* Any candidate rated 0 by a majority is eliminated, if any would remain. 
** (If there are any candidates rated 2 by a majority, you should eliminate any who aren't. But a majority-2 candidate would probably win in the next step anyway, so this step is probably superfluous. It's just included because it's part of Bucklin voting, which was used in over a dozen US cities, and thus it gives this method a stronger pedigree.) 
* Then the points are added up for the remaining candidates, and the highest points wins.

Blank votes are counted as ratings of 1 or 0 in proportion to the fraction of all voters who gave the candidate a 2. For example, a candidate could not win with more than 71% blank votes, because even if the other 29% are all 2-ratings, that would leave 71%*71%=50.41% 0-votes, enough to eliminate.

Here's a google spreadsheet to calculate results: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1siFG6XmOZokygY-86EhAKgv8YwzKtTET6AJopyXRqu0/edit#gid=0]. On page 1, it has some examples of how different combinations of ratings would come out, suggesting that it could work well in both [[chicken dilemma]] and [[center squeeze]] scenarios. On page 2, it has some hypothetical results for the Egypt 2012 election, showing that this system could have elected a reformer over Morsi, despite vote-splitting among the various reformers. IRV could have elected Morsi.

== An example ==

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Assume half of voters in each city rate one city 2, one city 1, and two cities 0; and half rate one 2, leave two blank, and one 0.

Only Chatanooga is rated above 0 by a majority, so Chatanooga (the [[Condorcet winner]]) wins, even though Memphis has a slightly higher score.
