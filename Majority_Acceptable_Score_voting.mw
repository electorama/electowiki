Majority Acceptable Score voting works as follows:

Voters rate candidates 0, 1, or 2. Any candidate rated 0 by a majority is eliminated, unless that eliminates all candidates. Then the points are added up for the remaining candidates and the highest points wins.

Blank votes are counted as ratings of 1 or 0 in proportion to the fraction of all voters who gave the candidate a 2. For example, a candidate 29% 2-ratings and 71% blank votes will get 71% of 71%, or 50.41%, of 0 ratings, and thus be eliminated.

Here's a google spreadsheet to calculate results: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1siFG6XmOZokygY-86EhAKgv8YwzKtTET6AJopyXRqu0/edit#gid=0]. It has some hypothetical results for the Egypt 2012 election.
