----

In the chicken dilemma scenario described in the premise of the Chicken Dilemma Criterion (CD) defined above, if B won, then the B voters would have successfully taken advantage of the A voters' co-operativeness. The A voters wanted to vote both A and B over the candidates disliked by both the A voters and B voters. Thereby they helped {A,B} against worse candidates. But, with methods that fail CD, the message is "You help, you lose".

'''Some methods that pass the Chicken Dilemma Criterion:'''
