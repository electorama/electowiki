'''Proportional Ordering''' is a [[ranking method]] proposed by James Green-Armytage in December 2004.  The ordering is intended so that a [[semi-proportional]] set of ''n'' candidates can be obtained by taking the first ''n'' candidates from the ranking.

== Definition ==

Start by choosing the [[Condorcet method | Condorcet]] winner.  To choose the ''k''th candidate, perform a [[CPO-STV]] tally considering only the outcomes that include the previously chosen k-1 candidates; this will add one new candidate to the ranking.  Repeat the process until all candidates have been ranked.

== Example ==

Suppose there are four candidates: Andrea (A), Brad (B), Carter (C), and Delilah (D). The ballots are:

* 5: A>B>C>D
* 17: A>C>B>D
* 8: D

=== First Candidate ===

Andrea is the Condorcet winner, so she is the first candidate in the ordering.

=== Second Candidate ===

To choose the second-place candidate, we consider the sets of two candidates including Andrea: {A, B}, {A, C}, and {A, D}.

In the CPO-STV comparison for {A, B} versus {A, C}, D is eliminated, leaving

*  5: A>B>C
* 17: A>C>B

After transferring A's excess votes, {A, C} beats {A, B}.

The CPO-STV comparison for {A, B} versus {A, D} eliminates C, leaving

* 22: A>B>D
* 8: D

With the two-seat Droop quota of 11 votes, A meets the quota with 11 excess votes, all transferring to B, giving a vote count of:

* A: 11
* B: 11
* D: 8
* A+B: 22
* A+D: 19

So {A, B} beats {A, D}.

Finally, the CPO-STV comparison for {A, C} versus {A, D} gives a vote count of:

* A: 11
* C: 11
* D: 8
* A+C: 22
* A+D: 19

So {A, C} beats {A, D}.

The set {A, C} is the Condorcet winner (beating both {A, B} and {A, D}).  Therefore, Carter is the second candidate in the proportional ordering.

=== Third candidate ===

We now consider the sets of three candidates containing both Andrea and Carter, i.e., {A, C, B} and {A, C, D}.  The inital first-choice vote counts are:

* A: 22
* B: 8

Andrea is in both outcomes, so her votes are transferred.  Using the three-seat Droop quota of 8 votes with [[fractional transfer]] gives her a retention fraction of 1-8/22 = 7/11.  Applying this to the A>B>C>D and A>C>B>D ballots gives.

* 3+2/11: (A)>B>C>D
* 10+9/11: (A)>C>B>D
* 8: D

Now, Carter has a surplus as well, all of which transfers to Brad, giving the ballots:

* 3+2/11: (A)>B>(C)>D
* 2+9/11: (A>C)>B>D
* 8: D

Vote transfers are now complete.  The vote totals for each candidate are:

* A: 8 (quota)
* B: 6
* C: 8 (quota)
* D: 8
* A+C+B: 22
* A+C+D: 24

Thus, {A, C, D} beats {A, C, B}, so Delilah is the next candidate chosen.

=== Final ordering ===

Brad is now the only candidate left and is added to the end of the ranking.  The final proportional ordering is:

#Andrea
#Carter
#Delilah
#Brad
