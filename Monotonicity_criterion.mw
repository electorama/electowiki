A [[voting system]] is '''monotonic''' if it satisfies the following so-called ''monotonicity criterion'' given below. In [[mathematics]], monotonicity usually refers to the different concept of a [[monotonic function]].

The '''monotonicity criterion''' for voting systems is the following statement:

:''If an alternative X loses, and the ballots are changed only by placing X in lower positions, without changing the relative position of other candidates, then X must still lose.''

A slicker, though looser, way of phrasing this is that in a non-monotonic system, voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to lose.

It is considered a good thing if a voting system is monotonic.  Clearly, non-monotonicity is very counterintuitive, although some do defend such systems (see [[Instant-runoff voting]]).  Furthermore, although all voting systems are vulnerable to [[tactical voting]], systems which fail the monotonicity criterion suffer an unusual form, where voters might try to elect their candidate by voting against that candidate.

[[Plurality voting]], [[Majority Choice Approval]], [[Borda count]], [[Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]], and [[Maximize Affirmed Majorities]] are monotonic, while [[Coombs' method]] and [[Instant-runoff voting]] are not.  [[Approval voting]] is monotonic, using a slightly different definition, because it is not a preferential system: you can never help a candidate by not voting for them.
