A [[voting system]] is '''monotonic''' if it satisfies the ''monotonicity criterion'':

:''If an alternative X loses, and the ballots are changed only by placing X in lower positions, without changing the relative position of other candidates, then X must still lose.''

This criterion is also called '''Mono-raise'''.

A looser way of phrasing this is that in a non-monotonic system, voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to lose. Systems which fail the monotonicity criterion suffer a form of [[tactical voting]] where voters might try to elect their candidate by voting against that candidate.

[[Plurality voting]], [[Majority Choice Approval]], [[Borda count]], [[Schulze method|Schulze]], [[Maximize Affirmed Majorities]], and [[Descending Solid Coalitions]] are monotonic, while [[Coombs' method]] and [[Instant-runoff voting]] are not. [[Approval voting]] is monotonic, using a slightly different definition, because it is not a preferential system: you can never help a candidate by not voting for them.
