A '''ratings ballot''', or '''cardinal ballot''', is a ballot in which, for each candidate, a voter is asked to "rate" the candidate on a scale, for example from 0 to 100 or from -5 to 5. Ratings are usually (though not always) restricted to integer values.

An [[approval ballot]] can be thought of as a ratings ballot with an integer scale from 0 to 1 (inclusive).

[[Voting system]]s which use a ratings ballot include [[range voting]], [[Instant Runoff Normalized Ratings|instant runoff normalized ratings]], and [[cardinal pairwise]].
