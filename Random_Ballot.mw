'''Random ballot''', also known as '''random dictatorship''', is a [[voting system]] in which the first preference candidate of a ballot drawn at random is elected.

When the drawn ballot is not decisive, then additional ballots are drawn and used only to resolve the indecision of previously drawn ballots.

== Properties ==

Random Ballot satisfies the [[Plurality criterion]], [[Monotonicity criterion]], [[Participation criterion]], [[Later-no-harm criterion]], Clone Independence, [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], and [[Pareto criterion]].

However, Random Ballot fails the [[Mutual majority criterion|Majority criterion]], [[Condorcet criterion]], [[Smith set|Smith criterion]], and [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]].

===Example===
{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Memphis wins with 42% probability, Nashville with 26%, Chattanooga 15%, and Knoxville 17%. If the Knoxville voters had instead ranked Knoxville and Chattanooga equally, then Knoxville would win with 0% probability, since it would be impossible to draw a ballot which prefers Knoxville to Chattanooga.
