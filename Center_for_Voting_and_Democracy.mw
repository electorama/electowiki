The '''Center for Voting and Democracy''' is a [[non-profit]] organization based in [[Takoma Park, Maryland]] which provides information to the public about the impact of [[voting system]]s on political representation, [[proportional representation]], and [[voter turnout]].  It was founded in [[1992]] by scholars, civic leaders, and former elected officials such as [[John Bayard Anderson]], the former Illinois congressman who [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|ran for president in 1980]].  Since CVD's founding, [[Rob Richie]] has served as its executive director and lead organizer.

The Center advocates for the greater use of [[Instant-runoff voting]] in single-winner elections, and [[Single Transferable Vote]] systems and other forms of proportional representation in multiple-winner elections. It also issues reports on legislative [[redistricting]] and competition in U.S. Congressional elections.

In [[2003]] it launched the Democracy USA initiative, which seeks to initiate greater cooperation and coordination among pro-[[democracy]] organizations.
