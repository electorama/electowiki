The '''weak defensive strategy criterion''' is .... [''Please help complete this article.'']

==Statement of criterion==

<em>If a majority prefers one particular candidate to another, then
they should have a way of voting that will ensure that the other cannot
win, without any member of that majority reversing a preference for one
candidate over another.</em>

==Complying methods==

[[Majority-choice approval]], [[Schulze method|Schulze]], and [[approval voting|approval]] methods comply with the weak defensive strategy criterion, while [[Range voting]], [[Borda count]], [[plurality voting]], and [[instant-runoff voting]] do not comply.

==Commentary==

WDSC is identical to the [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] (SDSC), except that the phrase "or falsely voting two candidates equal" is removed from the end. That difference allows the [[approval voting|approval]] method to comply.
