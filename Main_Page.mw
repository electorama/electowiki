Welcome to Electowiki!  This is a wiki associated with [http://www.electorama.com Electorama], the [[Election-methods mailing list]], and communities of election-minded people.  

=== Election Methods ===

There has been an increasing awareness in many parts of the world of the effect that different [[:Category:Voting systems|election methods]] (voting systems, voting methods, etc; this site uses these words interchangeably) have on the quality and timbre of elections and democracy.  There are movements for [[proportional representation]], [[instant-runoff voting]], [[Condorcet method|Condorcet]].  This site gives you a guide to what these things are.  

But it also goes one step further: there is a vast literature on the [[:Category:Voting theory|theory]] behind these systems: what [[:Category:Voting system criteria|criteria]] can you use to judge whether a particular method works well?  What [[tactical voting|strategies]] will different systems encourage voters to use?  We record the collective wisdom of scholars and enthusiasts, and, by working together, hope to create a canonical reference for all to use.
