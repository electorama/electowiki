The '''Mutual majority criterion''' is a criterion for evaluating [[voting system]]s.  It applies to [[ranked ballot]] elections.  It can be stated as follows:

:''If there is a majority of voters for which it is true that they all rank a set of candidates above all others, then one of these candidates must win.''

This is often called '''Majority criterion for solid coalitions''' or simply '''Majority criterion'''.

[[Borda-Elimination]], [[Bucklin voting|Bucklin]], [[Coombs]], [[IRV]], [[Kemeny-Young]], [[Nanson (original)]], [[Raynaud|Pairwise-Elimination]], [[Ranked Pairs]], [[Schulze method|Schulze]], [[Smith//Minimax|Smith//Minmax]], [[Descending Solid Coalitions]], [[Majority Choice Approval]]
