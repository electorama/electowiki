[end of Schwartz Woodall definition]
 
There are two equivalent definitions of the Schwartz set:
 
X beats Y if more ballots rank X over Y than rank Y over X.
 
The beatpath definition of the Schwartz set:
 
There is a beatpath from X to Y if either X beats Y, or X beats
something that has a beatpath to Y.
 
X has a beatpath to Y if there is a beatpath from X to Y.
 
X is in the Schwartz set if there is no Y such that there is a
beatpath from Y to X, but not from X to Y.

The unbeaten set definition of the Schwartz set:
 
1. An unbeaten set is a set of candidates none of whom are beaten by
anyone outside that set.
 
2. An innermost unbeaten set is an unbeaten set that doesn't contain a
smaller unbeaten set.
 
3. The Schwartz set is the set of candidates who are in innermost unbeaten sets.
