(abbreviated ZLNHe)


== Definition of ZLNHe: ==


----


'''Supporting definitions:'''

1. A zero-information (0-info) election is an election about which all
that is known is the candidates and the voting system. There's no
information about the voters, their preferences, or any predictive
information about details of the voting.

2. To vote a candidate at bottom is to not vote that candidate over
anyone. To vote a candidate above bottom is to vote that candidate
over someone.

'''Zero-Info LNHe (ZLNHe):'''

In a 0-info election, voting above bottom one or more of some certain
set of candidates shouldn't decrease the probability that the winner
will come from that set, as compared to voting them all at bottom.

ZLNHe could be called a "weakening" of LNHe. But calling it "weak
LNHe" would be misleading, because it is only very slightly
weaker than LNHe.

It's easier to refer to a 0-info election than to try to name
different kinds of voting-predictive information and stipulate them to be absent. But the information
that actually must be absent in that criterion's scenario is
information that is usually or always at least mostly absent even in non-0-info
elections. Therefore, ZLNHe is nearly the same thing as LNHe, and the
word "weakening" hardly even applies.



== Definition of Strong ZLNHe: ==


----

Same as ZLNHe, except that voting one or more members of that set over
bottom must increase the probability that the winner will come from
that set.

== Complyng methods: ==

Of course all methods that meet LNHe also meet ZLNHe.

Methods that comply with LNHe include [[Approval voting]], Score Voting (also called [[Range voting]]), and IRV.

[[Symmetrical ICT]] meets Strong ZLNHe.

Ordinary ICT, and traditional Condorcet methods don't comply with ZLNHe or Strong ZLNHe.
