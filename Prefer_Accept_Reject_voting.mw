Prefer Accept Reject (PAR) voting works as described below:

# Voters can Prefer, Accept, or Reject each candidate. Default is Accept.
# Candidates with a majority of Reject, or with under 25% Prefer, are eliminated, unless that would eliminate all candidates.
# The winner is the non-eliminated candidate rated equal-or-above any other non-eliminated candidate on the most ballots.

== Relationship to NOTA ==

If all the candidates in the first round got a majority of reject, then the voters have sent a message that none of the candidates are good, akin to a result of "[[none of the above]]" (NOTA). PAR still gives a winner, but it might be good to have a rule that such a winner could only serve one term, or perhaps a softer rule that if they run for the same office again, the information of what percent of voters rejected should be next to their name on the ballot.

== Criteria compliance == 

PAR voting passes the [[favorite betrayal criterion]], the [[majority criterion]], the [[mutual majority criterion]], [[Local independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (under the assumption of fixed "honest" ratings for each voter for each candidate), [[Independence of clone alternatives]], [[Monotonicity]], [[polytime]], [[resolvability]], and the [[later-no-help criterion]].

There are a few criteria for which it does not pass as such, but where it passes related but weaker criteria. These include:

* It fails [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]], but passes [[Local independence of irrelevant alternatives]].

* It fails the [[Condorcet criterion]], but for any set of voters such that an honest majority Condorcet winner exists, there always exists a strong equilibrium set of strictly semi-honest ballots that elects that CW.

* It fails the [[participation criterion]] but passes the [[semi-honest participation criterion]].

* It fails the [[Strategy-free criterion]], but, as shown in the center squeeze scenario below, in a 3-candidate scenario it does at least offer viable strategies to each of the subgroups of the majority that prefers X>Y, such that either of the potentially-strategic subgroups has a strategy to ensure Y loses, even if the other potentially-strategic subgroup does not maximally cooperate. ("Subgroup" in this sense is characterized by whether they prefer Z over or under both. The assumption is that the "honest" vote is Support, Accept, Reject in some order for the three candidates, or only Support and Reject in case of indifference between two of them. This guarantees that any X>Z>Y voters will maximally cooperate under honesty, so this subgroup is not potentially-strategic.)

* It fails O(N) [[summability]], but can get that summability with two-pass tallying (first determine who's eliminated, then retally).

It fails the [[consistency criterion]], the [[Condorcet loser criterion]], [[reversibility]], the [[majority loser criterion]], and the [[later-no-harm criterion]].

== An example ==

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Assume voters in each city preferred their own city; rejected any city that is over 200 miles away or is the farthest city; and accepted the rest.

Memphis is rejected by a majority, and is eliminated. Chattanooga and Knoxville both get less than 25% preference, so they are also eliminated. Nashville wins with a tally of 100%. This is a strong equilibrium; no rational strategy from any faction or combination thereof would change the winner. Knoxville and/or Chattanooga could each prevent the other from being eliminated, but Nashville would still win with a tally of at least 68 (the ballots of Nashville and Memphis).

(If Memphis voters rejected Nashville, then Chattanooga or Knoxville could win by conspiring to reject Nashville and accept Memphis. However, Nashville could stop this by rejecting them. Thus this strategy would not work without extreme foolishness from both Memphis and Nashville voters, and extreme amounts of strategy from the others.)
