Simple Optionally-Delegated Approval (SODA) is a single-winner voting system based on [[approval voting]], where voters can vote for as many candidates as they like. Voters who don't want to decide whether they approve each candidate can choose to delegate their ballot to one of the candidates.  The voters' ballots are counted and the totals are announced, and then candidates can choose to exercise the ballots delegated to them, approving other candidates who they think would be good compromise options if they cannot win themselves.

After all candidates exercise their delegated ballots, the winner is the candidate with the most approvals.

== Details ==

For simplicity, the ballot is organized like an approval ballot.  It is assumed that voters who vote for only one candidate are intending to delegate their ballot to that candidate, but an option is provided for voters to indicate that they don't want their ballot delegated even though they only voted for one candidate.

Candidates are required to submit a rank-ordering of all the other candidates before the election.  This is to help voters understand how that candidate might choose to complete their delegated ballots, and also to vastly decrease the opportunities for manipulation when the candidates exercise their ballots.  When they exercise the ballots delegated to them, the candidates must approve others in a way that is consistent with the rank-ordering they submitted.  In other words, they must take their submitted rank-ordering and choose a cutoff point, approving all candidates above that point and disapproving all candidates below that point.

To further decrease the opportunities for manipulation, there is a certain order in which the candidates are required to exercise their delegated ballots.  This order is generated based on the ballots submitted by the voters, using an algorithm designed to encourage good outcomes in certain problematic situations.  See the full [[Simple Optionally-Delegated Approval]] page for more information.
