'''Copeland's method''' is a [[Condorcet method]] in which the winner is determined by finding the candidate with the most pairwise victories.  

Proponents argue that this method is more understandable to the general populace, which is generally familiar with the sporting equivalent.  In many team sports, the teams with the greatest number of victories in regular season matchups make it to the playoffs.

This method leads to ties in cases where the outcome is different than in Condorcet's method (i.e. when there are multiple members of the [[Smith set]]).  Critics argue that it also puts too much emphasis on the quantity of pairwise victories rather than the magnitude of those victories (or conversely, of the defeats).
