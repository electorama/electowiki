River is a cloneproof monotonic [[Condorcet_method#Different_ambiguity_resolution_methods|Condorcet ambiguity resolution method]] with similarities to both [[Ranked Pairs]] and [[Schulze method|Schulze]], but when cycles exist, can in rare cases find a different winner than either of the other two methods.

Quick summary of method, which is identical to Ranked Pairs except where emphasized:
* Rank defeats in descending order of winning vote strength.
* Starting with the strongest defeat, affirm defeats unless a cycle is created ''or a candidate is defeated twice''.

The result is that only sufficient defeat information to determine the winner is included.

Because not all defeats are processed, the social ordering is not linear -- in general it is a tree (or river) diagram, with the victor at the base of the river.

It was first proposed by [[User:Heitzig-j|Jobst Heitzig]] on the [[Election-methods mailing list]]:
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/078029.html First proposal]
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/012706.html slight refinement]
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-October/014018.html More concise definition].  In this last version, River is defined very similarly to ranked pairs.
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-October/014147.html Example using 2004 baseball scores].  This shows how a 14-candidate election winner can be determined much more quickly using River than with RP or [[Schulze method|Schulze]].
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/012713.html Early criticism of the River method].   This shows that the River method violates mono-add-top and mono-remove-bottom

River can be interpreted as a [[Minmax]] method, Minmax(non-cyclic pairwise loss) or MMNCPL.  It is similar to Minmax(winning votes) except that River elects the candidate whose greatest ''non-cyclic'' pairwise loss to another candidate is least.  As in [[Ranked Pairs]], the greatest pairwise loss (GPL) of each candidate is considered in order from largest (among all candidates) to smallest and locked.  If a candidate's GPL is cyclic, it is discarded, and the next-greatest pairwise loss of that candidate is added to the list.  When the non-cyclic greatest pairwise losses of (N-1) candidates have been locked, the remaining candidate is the winner.

Number of operations:  for each candidate, determine greatest pairwise loss [O(N)];  For all unlocked candidates' GPLs, determine maximum GPL [O(N)].  So the complexity is O(N^2) at best.  At worst, N-1 of the candidates could have N-1 cyclic GPLs each, requiring another O(N) max-searches each, taking the order of operations up to O(N^3).
