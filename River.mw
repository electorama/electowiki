River is a cloneproof monotonic [[Condorcet method]] with similarities to both [[Ranked Pairs]] and [[Cloneproof Schwarz Sequential Dropping]], but when cycles exist, can in rare cases find a different winner than either of the other two methods.

It was first proposed by Jobst Heitzig on the election-methods mailing list:  http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-October/013971.html
