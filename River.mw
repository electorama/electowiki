River is a cloneproof monotonic [[Condorcet_method#Different_ambiguity_resolution_methods|Condorcet ambiguity resolution method]] with similarities to both [[Ranked Pairs]] and [[Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]], but when cycles exist, can in rare cases find a different winner than either of the other two methods.

Quick summary of method, which is identical to Ranked Pairs except where emphasized:
* Rank defeats in descending order of winning vote strength.
* Starting with the strongest defeat, affirm defeats unless a cycle is created ''or a candidate is defeated twice''.

The result is that only sufficient defeat information to determine the winner is included.

Because not all defeats are processed, the social ordering is not linear -- in general it is a tree (or river) diagram, with the victor at the base of the river.

It was first proposed by [[User:Heitzig-j|Jobst Heitzig]] on the [[Election-methods mailing list]]:
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/012666.html First proposal]
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/012671.html slight refinement]
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-October/013971.html More concise definition].  In this last version, River is defined very similarly to ranked pairs.
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-October/014102.html Example using 2004 baseball scores].  This shows how a 14-candidate election winner can be determined much more quickly using River than with RP or Beatpath.
* [http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2004-April/012678.html Early criticism of the River method].   This shows that the River method violates mono-add-top and mono-remove-bottom
