'''Open Seat''' refers to an elective office during an election cycle in which no [[incumbent]] office holder seeks re-election.  Given the incumbency advantage in legislative elections in the United States and Japan, such races typically offer non-incumbents their greatest probability of winning office.  As a consequence, the electoral competition for open seats is often more intense than in other races.
