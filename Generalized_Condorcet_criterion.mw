The '''Generalized Condorcet criterion''' or '''Smith criterion''' for a [[voting system]] is that it picks the winner from the [[Smith set]], the smallest set of candidates such that every member of the set is preferred to every candidate not in the set. One candidate is preferred over another candidate if, in a one-on-one competition, more voters prefer the first candidate than prefer the other candidate.

Any election method that complies with the Generalized Condorcet criterion also complies with the [[Condorcet criterion]], since if there is a Condorcet winner, then that winner is the only member of the Smith set.

== Complying Methods ==

Among methods that comply with the Condorcet criterion, [[Schulze method|Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]] and [[Ranked Pairs]] comply with the Generalized Condorcet Criterion.

Methods that do not comply with the Condorcet criterion, such as [[Approval voting]], [[Cardinal Ratings]], [[Borda count]], [[Plurality voting]], and [[Instant-Runoff Voting]], do not with the Generalized Condorcet Criterion.
