'''Range voting''', or '''ratings summation''', or '''average rating''', or '''cardinal ratings''' is a [[voting system]] used for single-seat elections.  
(It can also be used for multi-seat elections, but not with proportional results.)
It is also used on the web - for rating movies (Internet Movie Database), comments (Kuro5hin), and many other things - and something very similar to it is used
in the Olympics to award gold medals to gymnasts.

== Voting ==

Range voting uses a [[ratings ballot]]; that is, each voter rates each candidate with a number.  In "pure numerical voting," each voter may give any candidate any real number
(i.e. not restricted to any finite range), 
but as the potential for [[tactical voting]] would then be
huge, most systems use upper and lower bounds.  For example, each voter might give a real number between -1 and 1, or 
between 0 and 99; in the latter case little is lost by also demanding that the
scores be integers.

Range voting in which only two different votes may be submitted (0 and 1, for example) is equivalent to [[approval voting]].
In range (or approval) voting <i>with blanks</i>, 
the voter is allowed to leave some scores blank to denote <i>ignorance</i>
about those candidates.

Range voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], the [[participation criterion]], the [[Consistency Criterion]], the [[summability criterion]], the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]], the [[Non-compulsory support criterion]] and [[Strategic nomination|independence of clones]].

Range voting does not comply with the [[Condorcet criterion]] because it allows for the difference between 'rankings' to matter.  E.g. 51 people might rate A at 100, and B at 90, while 49 people rate A at 0, and B at 100.  Condorcet would consider this 51 people voting A>B, and 49 voting B>A, and A would win.  Range voting would see this as A having support of 5100/100 = 51%, and B support of (51*90+49*100)/100 = 94.9%; range voting advocates would probably say that in this case the Condorcet winner is not the socially ideal winner.

== Counting the Votes ==

The scores for each candidate are summed, and the candidate with the highest sum is declared the winner.  In [[range voting with blanks]] the candidate with the highest
average score (where only nonblank scores are incorporated into the average)
is the winner.

(Another method of counting is to find the [[median]] score of each candidate, and elect the candidate with the highest median score - see [[Median Ratings]]. Because strategic voting will typically lead to a vast number of candidates with the same median, a secondary measure to resolve ties is needed.)

==Example==
{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Suppose that voters were told to grant 1 to 4 points to each city, giving their most favorite 4 points, second favorite 3 points, third favorite 2 points, and least favorite 1 point. For simplicity, letâ€™s say we had 42 voters from Memphis, 26 from Nashville, 15 from Chattanooga, and 17 from Knoxville. The votes would be as follows.


<TABLE BORDER=1 style="empty-cells: show">
		<TR>
			<TH>City</TH>
			<TH>Memphis</TH>
			<TH>Nashville</TH>
			<TH>Chattanooga</TH>
			<TH>Knoxville</TH>
			<TH>Total</TH>
		</TR>
                <TR>
			<TD>Memphis</TD>
			<TD>42 * 4 = 168</TD>
			<TD>26 * 1 =  26</TD>
			<TD>15 * 1 =  26</TD>
			<TD>17 * 1 =  26</TD>
			<TD>226</TD>
		</TR>
                <TR>
			<TD>Nashville</TD>
			<TD>42 * 3 = 126</TD>
			<TD>26 * 4 = 104</TD>
			<TD>15 * 2 =  30</TD>
			<TD>17 * 2 =  34</TD>
			<TD>294</TD>
		</TR>
                <TR>
			<TD>Chattanooga</TD>
			<TD>42 * 2 = 84</TD>
			<TD>26 * 3 = 78</TD>
			<TD>15 * 4 = 60</TD>
			<TD>17 * 3 = 51</TD>
			<TD>273</TD>
		</TR>
                <TR>
			<TD>Knoxville</TD>
			<TD>42 * 1 = 42</TD>
			<TD>26 * 2 = 52</TD>
			<TD>15 * 3 = 45</TD>
			<TD>17 * 4 = 68</TD>
			<TD>207</TD>
		</TR>
</TABLE>

Nashville wins.

==Strategy==

In general, the optimal strategy for range voting is to vote it identically to approval voting, so that all candidates are given either the maximum score or the minimum score. For more detailed strategies, see [[approval voting]].

Range voting has an advantage over approval voting if
voters are actually expressing their personal feelings rather 
than doing everything they can to cause their most favored outcomes.

==Supporters==
Supporters of range voting include [[Warren Smith]], [[Clay Shentrup]], [[Jan Kok]], and [[Steve Gruber]].
