A '''Smith method''' elects the "beats-all-winner" who would beat every other candidate in the two-choice head-to-head election got by erasing every other candidate from all votes. Smith method is a generalization of [[Condorcet method]] to encompass rated voting methods. A Smith method always elects a [[Smith winner]] if one exists. This concept was formulated by Warren D. Smith.
