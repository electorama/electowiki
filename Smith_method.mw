A '''Smith method''' is any voting method that it always elects a "beats-all-winner" if one exists. A "beats-all-winner" is a candidate who would beat every other candidate in the two-choice head-to-head election got by erasing every other candidate from all votes. The Smith method is a generalization of [[Condorcet method]] to encompass rated methods. Warren D. Smith first formulated this definition.
