'''Approval Elimination Runoff''' ('''AER''') or '''Approval AV''' is an [[IRV]] variant under which one eliminates the least-approved candidate until there is a majority favorite.

It is similar to [[DMC]] except that DMC finishes once there is a Condorcet winner, not a majority favorite. AER can potentially eliminate the Condorcet winner.

Approval is usually envisioned as being implied by ranking the candidate.
