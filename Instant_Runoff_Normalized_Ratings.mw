Based on a [[ratings ballot]], IRNR seeks to give every voter equal power and encourage honest ratings.

The first step is normalizing, which can happen in two ways.

* Divide each rating by the sum of the absolute values of the ratings. The sum of the absolute values of the ratings will then be 1.
* Divide each rating by the square root of the sum of the squared ratings. The vote will then be a vector with magnitude equal to 1.

Sum up the normalized ratings for each candidate. If there are two choices, the highest rated is the winner. If there are more than two choices, disqualify the lowest rated choice.

The process repeats with a normalization step that ignores disqualified choices.  A voter's voting power is thus redistributed among the remaining choices.
