A [[preference-approval]] is a [[preference order]] that combines preference with approval.  It can contain either weak or strong preferences. 

==Restrictions== 

Here are some rationality restrictions on preference-approvals.  Suppose there exists two alternatives, x and y:

1) If a given voter prefers x over y, and approves y, then she must approve x.

2) If a given voter prefers x over y, and does not approve y, then she must not approve x.

3) If a given voter is indifferent between x and y, and approves x, then she must approve y.

4) If a given voter is indifferent between x and y, and does not approve x, then she must approve y.

Because of these rationality restrictions, some preference-approvals can be expressed as follows for alternatives x and y:

|x>y: "The voter prefers x over y, but approves neither."

|x=y: "The voter is indifferent between x and y, but approves neither."

x|y:  "The voter prefers x over y, but only approves x."

x>y|: "The voter prefers x over y, but approves both."

[[Steven Brams]] and [[Peter Fishburn]] used preference-approvals in their book ''Italic text''Approval Voting''Italic text'' in 1983, though it probably was used before then.
