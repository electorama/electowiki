A [[preference-approval]] is a [[preference order]] that combines preference with approval.  It can contain either weak or strong preferences. A complete preference-approval is a [[total preference order]].

==Rationality Restrictions== 

Here are some rationality restrictions on preference-approvals.  Suppose there exists two alternatives, x and y:

1) If a given voter prefers x over y, and approves y, then she must approve x.

2) If a given voter prefers x over y, and does not approve x, then she must not approve y.

3) If a given voter is indifferent between x and y, and approves x, then she must approve y.

4) If a given voter is indifferent between x and y, and does not approve x, then she must approve y.

He are some expressions of preference-approvals and translations into natural language:

|x>y: "The voter prefers x over y, but approves neither."

|x=y: "The voter is indifferent between x and y, but approves neither."

x|y:  "The voter prefers x over y, but only approves x."

x>y|: "The voter prefers x over y, but approves both."

[[Steven Brams]] and [[Peter Fishburn]] used preference-approvals in their book "Approval Voting" in 1983, though it probably was used before then.

There are 2, 8, 44, 308, ... different preference-approvals for 1, 2, 3, 4, ... candidates (Sloan's [http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A005649 A005649]).
