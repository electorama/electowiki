Correlated Instant Borda Runoff (CIBR) is a [[preferential voting|preferential]] [[voting system]] for single-winner elections, devised by Ken Kuhlman in May 2005 in order to reduce Borda's susceptability to [[clones]].

== Procedure ==

Candidates are scored according to the [[Borda count]].  The Borda loser of the [[candidate correlation|most-correlated]] pair of candidates is eliminated.  The process is repeated until only one candidate remains.
