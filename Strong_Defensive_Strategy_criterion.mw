<h4 class=left>Definitions</h4>

<p>A voter votes X equal to Y if the voter doesn't vote X over Y, and
doesn't vote Y over X, but votes X over someone, and votes Y over
someone.</p>

<p>A sincere vote is one with no falsified preferences or preferences
left unspecified when the election method allows them to be specified
(in addition to the preferences already specified).</p>

<p>One candidate is preferred over another candidate if, in a one-on-one
competition, more voters prefer the first candidate than prefer the
other candidate.</p>

<h4 class=left>Statement of Criterion</h4>

<p><em>If a majority prefers one particular candidate to another, then
they should have a way of voting that will ensure that the other cannot
win, without any member of that majority reversing a preference for one
candidate over another or falsely voting two candidates equal.</em></p>

<h4 class=left>Complying Methods</h4>

<p>[[Schulze method|Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]] (with winning votes as the measure of defeat strength), [[Maximize Affirmed Majorities]], and [[CDTT]] methods comply with the Strong Defensive Strategy Criterion, while [[Approval voting]], [[Cardinal Ratings]], [[Borda count]], [[Plurality voting]], [[Instant-Runoff Voting]], [[Raynaud]], and [[Descending Solid Coalitions]] do not comply.</p>

<h4 class=left>Commentary</h4>

<p>Compliance with SDSC means that a majority never needs any more than
[[truncation strategy]] to defeat a particular candidate, even when
countering [[offensive order reversal]] by that candidate's voters.
Offensive order reversal is the only strategy that can create the need
for defensive strategy in [[Schulze method|Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]].</p>

A very similar criterion is the [[Minimal Defense criterion]].
