The '''Smith winner''' is the "beats-all-winner" who would beat every other candidate in the two-choice head-to-head election got by erasing every other candidate from all votes. The Smith winner is a generalization of [[Condorcet winner]] to encompass rated voting methods.  A [[Smith method]] always elects a Smith winner. This concept was formulated by mathematician Warren D. Smith.
