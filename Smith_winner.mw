The '''Smith winner''' is the "beats-all-winner" who would beat every other candidate in the two-choice head-to-head election got by erasing every other candidate from all votes. The Smith winner is a generalization of the [[pairwise champion]] (aka Condorcet winner) to encompass rated voting methods.  A [[Smith method]] always elects a Smith winner if one exists. 

In common usage, "Smith winner" usually refers to any member of the [[Smith set]].
