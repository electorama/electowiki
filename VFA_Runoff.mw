'''VFA Runoff''' is a type of two-round [[runoff voting]], but using the [[Vote For and Against]] ballot in the first round of voting. If a candidate receives more than half of the ''against'' votes in the first round, this candidate is barred from the second round. Other than this, the two candidates with the most ''for'' votes advance to the second round, which uses a simple "vote for one" ballot.

In a first-round scenario such as:

  49 voters vote for A, against C
  24 voters vote for B, against A
  27 voters vote for C, against A

Standard VFA will elect C outright, while VFA Runoff will hold a second round between B and C. This way, the A supporters have the ability to transfer their support.

== Example ==
{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Assume that in the first round, voters vote ''for'' their top preference and ''against'' their last preference.

Memphis is disqualified from advancing due to receiving more than half of the ''against'' votes. So unlike a standard two-round, top-two runoff, the second round is between Nashville and Chattanooga rather than Memphis and Nashville.

In the second round, Nashville defeats Chattanooga 68% to 22%.

If the Memphis supporters had preferred Chattanooga to Nashville, then while a standard runoff or VFA would elect Nashville, while VFA Runoff would elect Chattanooga.
