Cardinal voting systems, aka evaluative, rated, graded, or absolute systems, are ones in which the voter can evaluate each candidate independently on the same scale. Unlike ranked systems, a voter can give two candidates the same rating or not use some ratings at all if they desire, and skipped ratings can affect the result. Examples include [[Score voting]], [[approval voting]], and [[majority approval voting]].
