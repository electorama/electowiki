Each possible complete ranking of the candidates is given a "distance"
score. For each pair of candidates, find the number of ballots that
order them the the opposite way as the given ranking. The distance is
the sum across all such pairs. The ranking with the least distance wins.

The winning candidate is the top candidate in the winning ranking.

==Strategic Vulnerability==
  
Kemeny-Young is vulnerable to [[Tactical voting|compromising]], [[Tactical voting|burying]], and [[Strategic nomination|crowding]].

==Example==

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Consider the ranking Nashville>Chattanooga>Knoxville>Memphis.  This ranking contains 6 orderings of pairs of candidates:

* Nashville>Chattanooga, for which 32% of the voters disagree.
* Nashville>Knoxville, for which 32% of the voters disagree.
* Nashville>Memphis, for which 42% of the voters disagree.
* Chattanooga>Knoxville, for which 17% of the voters disagree.
* Chattanooga>Memphis, for which 42% of the voters disagree.
* Knoxville>Memphis, for which 42% of the voters disagree.

The distance score for this ranking is 32+32+42+17+42+42=207.

It can be shown that this ranking is the one with the lowest distance score.  Therefore, the winning ranking is Nashville>Chattanooga>Knoxville>Memphis, and so the winning candidate is Nashville.
