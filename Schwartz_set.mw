The '''Schwartz set''' is the union of all possible sets of candidates such that for every set:
# every candidate inside the set is pairwise unbeatable by any other candidate outside the set, i.e. ties are allowed
# no proper (smaller) subset of the set fulfills the first property
The Schwartz set is always a subset of the [[Smith set]], although not necessarily a ''smaller'' (i.e., proper) subset.
