A ''relative criterion'' requires that when the ballots are changed in some way, the result of the election must or must not change in some way. This is in contrast to an [[absolute criterion]], which requires some result given some characteristic of a set of ballots.

===Examples of relative criteria===

*[[Monotonicity criterion]]
*[[Participation criterion]]
*[[Later-no-harm criterion]]
*[[Sincere Favorite criterion]]
*[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]
*[[Strategic nomination|Independence of clones]]
*[[Neutrality of Spoiled Ballots]]
