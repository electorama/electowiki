==Concise Definition==
A given voter [[consents]] to an alternative if she is willing to form a [[consensus]] around that alternative.  

==More Details==
If a voter does not consent to an alternative, then she is not willing to form a consensus around an alternative.  A voter can consent to more than one alternative.  However, there are some rationality restrictions as to which alternatives an individual voter can consent to when she publicly expresses them.

==Rationality Restrictions==
Suppose there exists some given voter i who is confronted with the alternatives Ax, Ay, and Az.  There are four rationality restrictions.

First, if voter i Ax>Ay and consents to Ay, then voter i must consent to Ax.  

Second, if voter i Ax>Ay and does not consent to Ax, then voter i must not consent to Ay.  

Third, if voter i Ax=Ay and consents to Ax, then voter i must consent to Ay.  

Fourth, if voter i Ax=Ay and does not consent to Ax, then voter i must not consent to Ay.  

These rules allow us to express voter consent in conjunction with a [[preference order]].  Such expressions are called [[preference-approvals]], or [[total preference orders]] when it contains all alternatives.   Total preference orders look exactly like complete preference orders, except they have a line that separates consented alternatives from non-consented alternatives.
