'''Majority Defeat Disqualification Approval''' or '''MDDA''' is a method devised by Kevin Venzke for the purpose of showing that the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Strategy-Free criterion]], and [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] are mutually compatible. The name was given by Mike Ossipoff.

This method can be viewed as a variant of [[Improved Condorcet Approval]].

Another method with these properties is [[Majority Approval, Minimum Pairwise Opposition]].

==Procedure==
The voter submits a ranking of the candidates. The candidates explicitly ranked are considered ''approved'' by that voter.

A candidate is ''dominated'' if more than half of the voters rank some other candidate strictly above him.

All dominated candidates are eliminated, unless this would eliminate all the candidates.

Of remaining candidates, the one approved by the most voters is elected.

==Criteria==
'''MDDA''' satisfies the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] (and [[Minimal Defense criterion]]), [[Monotonicity criterion|monotonicity]], and (''check this'') the [[Plurality criterion]].

It fails [[Strategic nomination|Clone-Winner]], the [[Generalized Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Condorcet criterion]], the [[Smith set|Smith criterion]], [[Participation criterion|Participation]], the [[Majority criterion|Majority criterion for solid coalitions]], and [[Later-no-harm criterion|Later-no-harm]].
