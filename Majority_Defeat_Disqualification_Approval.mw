'''Majority Defeat Disqualification Approval''' or '''MDDA''' is a method devised by Kevin Venzke for the purpose of showing that the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Strategy-Free criterion]], and [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] are mutually compatible. The name was given by Mike Ossipoff.

==Procedure==
The voter submits a ranking of the candidates. The candidates explicitly ranked are considered ''approved'' by that voter.

A candidate is ''dominated'' if more than half of the voters rank some other candidate strictly above him.

Sort the candidates so that all undominated candidates, if any exist, come before all dominated candidates. Within each group, sort of the candidates in descending order of approval.

Elect the first candidate in the resulting ranking.

==Criteria==
'''MDDA''' satisfies the [[Favorite Betrayal criterion]], [[Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Strong Defensive Strategy criterion]] (and [[Minimal Defense criterion]]), [[Monotonicity criterion|monotonicity]], and (''check this'') the [[Plurality criterion]].

It fails [[Strategic nomination|Clone-Winner]], the [[Generalized Strategy-Free criterion]], the [[Condorcet criterion]], the [[Smith set|Smith criterion]], [[Participation criterion|Participation]], the [[Majority criterion|Majority criterion for solid coalitions]], and [[Later-no-harm criterion|Later-no-harm]].

''Work in progress.''
