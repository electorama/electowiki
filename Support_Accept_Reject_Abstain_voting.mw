Support Accept Reject Abstain (SARA) voting works as described below. It's very similar to [[Majority Acceptable Score voting]], which is the [[graded Bucklin]] method which uses [[3 grade levels]] and breaks median ties using [[Score voting]].

# Voters can support, accept, reject, or abstain on each candidate.
# Call a candidate "acceptable" if they are rejected by under 50% and supported or accepted by over 25%. If any candidates are acceptable, eliminate all who aren't.
# Give remaining candidates 2 points for each "support", 1 point for each "accept", and half a point for each "abstain". Highest points wins.

== As the first round of a two-round system ("SARA with runoff") ==

If this system is used as the first round of a two-round runoff, then you want to use it to elect at two finalists in the first round. Thus, run the system twice. The first time, replace "50%" in step 2 with "2/3".

Then, to find the second winner, if the first-time winner got 1/3 or more support, first downweight those ballots as if you'd eliminated enough of them to make up 1/3 of the electorate. Otherwise, discard all of the ballots which supported first-time winner. After downweighting or discarding, run MAS normally.

If all the candidates in the first round got a majority of 0's, then you can still find two finalists as explained above. But the voters have sent a message that none of the candidates are good, so one way to deal with the situation would be to have a rule to allow candidates to transfer their 2-votes to new candidates who were not running in the first round, and if those transfers would have made the new candidates finalists, then add them to the second round along with the two finalists who did best in the first round. In that case, since there would be more than 2 candidates in the second round, it would be important to use MAS for the second round too.

== Relationship to NOTA ==

As discussed in the above section, if all the candidates in the first round got a majority "reject", then the voters have sent a message that none of the candidates are good, akin to a result of "[[none of the above]]" (NOTA). MAS still gives a winner, but it might be good to have a rule that such a winner could only serve one term, or perhaps a softer rule that if they run for the same office again, the information of what percent of voters rejected them should be next to their name on the ballot

== An example ==

{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Assume voters in each city give their own city 2; any city within 100 miles, 1; any city between 100 and 200 miles, a blank; and any city that is over 200 miles away or is the farthest city, 0. (These assumptions can be varied substantially without changing the result, but they seem reasonable to start with.)

Memphis is explicitly given 0 by a majority, and is eliminated. Chattanooga and Knoxville are both given 0 by a majority implicitly, so they are eliminated. Nashville remains and wins.

If Memphis voters tried to strategize by rating Nashville at 0 in the above scenario, Chattanooga and Knoxville voters could protect against this strategy if 2/3 of them gave Nashville a 1.
