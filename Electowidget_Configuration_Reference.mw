{{Electowidget Infopanel}}

The [[Electowidget]] configuration is a MediaWiki page in the "Election:" namespace with [http://json.org JSON]-formatted configuration information as the content of the page.  The configuration is read in as a single associative array or "map" at the root note, with a hierarchy of data contained within.

== Formatting rules==

Here are the basics of the formatting rules.  In each item in the [[#Configuration parameters]] section below, you'll see a data type in parenthesis (e.g. ''str'', ''bool'', ''map'', ''seq'').  These are the formatting rules for each type:

<dl>
<dt>''map''</dt>
<dd>This is a mapping of key/value pairs (also known as an "associative array" or a "hash").  Example <code>
 {
   "key_1" : "value_1",
   "key_2" : "value_2",
   ...
   "key_n" : "value_n"
 }
</code>

The key portion is always a ''str''.  The "value_x" portion may be any data type (including another ''map'' or a ''seq'').
</dd>
<dt>''seq''</dt>
<dd>An ordered sequence of unnamed values.
<code>
 [
   "value_1",
   "value_2",
   ...
   "value_n"
 ]
</code>
The "value_x" portion may be any data type (including another ''seq'' or a 'map'').
</dd>
<dt>''str''</dt>
<dd>A quoted string, e.g. <code>"Jefferson"</code></dd>
<dt>''int''</dt>
<dd>A positive or negative integer (e.g. <code>42</code> or <code>-163</code>)</dd>
<dt>''bool''</dt>
<dd><code>true</code> or <code>false</code></dd>

</dl>
Please visit the [http://json.org JSON website] for exhaustive documentation of JSON syntax.


== Configuration parameters ==

Below is documentation for each of the parameters, which are usually identified by the map keys (e.g. '''ballot_type''').  Map keys in parenthesis are not literal map keys, but rather are descriptive of user-defined keys that may be used in that context.  In the case of a sequence (''seq''), the child elements are unnamed parameters.
